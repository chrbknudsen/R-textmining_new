""I am offended as a libertarian … I am sorry, but the question IS whether government is too big!"" said one CurrentTV twitterer, determined not to let the excitement of the day stand in the way of maintaining a healthy debate on personal crusades.</p> <p>During the speech, the swichover of the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/uncivilizedphoto/3213281688/in/pool-inauguration2009"">White House website</a> to a new shiny web 2.0 special, blogs, galleries and all, caused a ripple of excitement among online communities, though most put off having a proper look until after the speech itself was over.</p> <p>And, when it was - during the poem reading that proved once more through polite applause and puzzled internet commentary that people don't really like Official National Poetry that much (apart from a few pleased and dissenting voices: ""Inaugural poem - 'We encounter each other in words.' So true for us here on twitter,"" said one) - the net came to life with reaction, debate, and people seeking to capture their moment.</p> <p>Flickr was busy creating an open pool of people at, watching, and giving their reaction to the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/inauguration2009/"">Inauguration</a>. A <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilychang/3212466161/"">tag cloud created by one flickr user</a> of Obama's speech, highlighting the words that were used most often - New; Nation; World; Common. It said.</p> <p>An hour after the oaths and the speechifying had finished, we sat and patiently waited for that promised satellite image. If they were saving it up this long, we reckoned, it must be something special. ""It's going to be"" said Wolf, once more ""REALLY cool.""</p> <p>The new president sat down to an inaugural lunch with congress. ""The <a href=""http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/"">recipe page for today's lunch</a> has been the most visited of the whole inauguration site!"" said Senator Diane Feinstein, intriguingly, in her introduction. </p> <p>And all the while, as the cameras left congress to a private lunch, the livebloggers on their webpages, the twitterers in their own little worlds, the anchors chuntered away in the studios:</p> <p>There goes President Bush's plane, they said. Here are the crowds lining the route of the parade yet to come. And … ""We're told there was some cloud cover, but you just wait - it's going to be VERY COOL"" said Wolf Blitzen, yet again, sounding like he was trying hard to reassure someone - though whether it was us or himself was hard to decide.</p> <p>Lunch ended, chilly crowds said happy things, bundled up in warm … coats? (Yep, coats!) behind barriers lining the roads, preparing for the motorcade. At home and in offices, people turned over their televisions in time for those soaps, and let the live streaming coverage from Washington fall back among the work-filled windows on their computer screen.</p> <p>But those who trust in Wolf sat, and waited, bottoms sore from perching so close to the edge of their chairs: because we weren't moving anywhere until we'd seen this thing From Outer Space.

So much for claiming back the name Hussain for universal use, they all said: Hussains all over the world must have felt their shoulders sag a little at the copping out (though they might have cheered up 20 minutes later when his full name was used in the oath) And then cross-cultural misunderstandings abounded on worldwide multimedia when Aretha Franklin stood up to sing God Save The Queen, but got the words wrong. (Sorry - it's the conventional British joke that must always be made upon hearing My Country 'Tis Of Thee.) She did it, though, in inimitable Aretha fashion, 66-years-old, with a full gospel choir singing 'Ringringringringring!"" at appropriate moments behind her. ""I hope the hat at least gets to sing a verse"" someone tweeted. And it could have, at that - in fact the bow atop it should have had a hat all its own. As the crowd hushed to listen to four world-class musicians play a new piece by John ""That guy who wrote the theme from Star Wars"" Williams, the news anchors, scared of silence - or, worse still, allowing people to listen to the music and somehow involve themselves in the ceremony - talked in short punchy clichés over the music. Part way through, at 12 noon precisely, a big sign flashed up on CNN: ""FACT: Barack Obama became president: the constitution states his term begins at noon even without oath"" Man, someone always has to try and call it first, don't they? As the oath was taken, people rejoiced in their own individual ways in various streams on twitter: ""I couldn't feel more inspired to put both feet squarely into adulthood."" was one ""Ah the end of an error [sic]. I feel a dark shadow has lifted off the capitol. Oh wait, that's because Cheney is sitting down."" The speech started. Certain tweeting celebrities (and many others) cheered the references to the importance of science and the existence of atheists. Others cheered in general, or merely followed their own agenda: ""Best President since Martin Sheen?"" - said another. ""I hope this is over in time for me to catch All My Children,"" said one more person joining wholeheartedly in the passage of history. And this is where the internet comes into its own - in the ability to pay listen out for your own area of interest, large or small, and feel free to give your opinion on exactly how correct (or not) that was. ""I am offended as a libertarian … I am sorry, but the question IS whether government is too big!"" said one CurrentTV twitterer, determined not to let the excitement of the day stand in the way of maintaining a healthy debate on personal crusades. During the speech, the swichover of the White House website to a new shiny web 2.0 special, blogs, galleries and all, caused a ripple of excitement among online communities, though most put off having a proper look until after the speech itself was over. And, when it was - during the poem reading that proved once more through polite applause and puzzled internet commentary that people don't really like Official National Poetry that much (apart from a few pleased and dissenting voices: ""Inaugural poem - 'We encounter each other in words.' So true for us here on twitter,"" said one) - the net came to life with reaction, debate, and people seeking to capture their moment. Flickr was busy creating an open pool of people at, watching, and giving their reaction to the Inauguration. A tag cloud created by one flickr user of Obama's speech, highlighting the words that were used most often - New; Nation; World; Common. It said. An hour after the oaths and the speechifying had finished, we sat and patiently waited for that promised satellite image. If they were saving it up this long, we reckoned, it must be something special. ""It's going to be"" said Wolf, once more ""REALLY cool."" The new president sat down to an inaugural lunch with congress. ""The recipe page for today's lunch has been the most visited of the whole inauguration site!"" said Senator Diane Feinstein, intriguingly, in her introduction. And all the while, as the cameras left congress to a private lunch, the livebloggers on their webpages, the twitterers in their own little worlds, the anchors chuntered away in the studios: There goes President Bush's plane, they said. Here are the crowds lining the route of the parade yet to come. And … ""We're told there was some cloud cover, but you just wait - it's going to be VERY COOL"" said Wolf Blitzen, yet again, sounding like he was trying hard to reassure someone - though whether it was us or himself was hard to decide. Lunch ended, chilly crowds said happy things, bundled up in warm … coats? (Yep, coats!) behind barriers lining the roads, preparing for the motorcade. At home and in offices, people turned over their televisions in time for those soaps, and let the live streaming coverage from Washington fall back among the work-filled windows on their computer screen. But those who trust in Wolf sat, and waited, bottoms sore from perching so close to the edge of their chairs: because we weren't moving anywhere until we'd seen this thing From Outer Space. Because even though it was over two hours ago - and even though we'd seen it from every considerable angle already, and even though there was all that cloud cover he'd been told about: it was, we still believed, going to be COOL. [Update, three hours after the ceremony: Still waiting.] [Five hours later: satellite image spotted! It is like google maps but with extra added ants. Brilliant. Glad we waited. Can I go to the toilet now?]",9000,Anna Pickard,NA,true,2009-01-20,"<span data-tag-id=""15391"" class=""contributor"">Anna Pickard</span>",2009-01-23T22:58:00Z

I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. </p> <p>Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. </p> <p>So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. </p> <p>That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet. </p> <p>These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights. </p> <p>Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met. </p> <p>On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. </p> <p>On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. </p> <p>We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.</p> <p>In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labour, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.</p> <p>For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.</p> <p>For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.</p> <p>For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. </p> <p>Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. </p> <p>This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. </p> <p>For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise healthcare's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.</p> <p>Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. </p> <p>What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.</p> <p>Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favours only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.</p> <p>As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our founding fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more. </p> <p>Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. </p> <p>We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.</p> <p>For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. </p> <p>To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. </p> <p>To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.</p> <p>As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honour them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. </p> <p>For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. </p> <p>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.</p> <p>This is the price and the promise of citizenship.</p> <p>This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.</p> <p>This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.</p> <p>So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: </p> <p>""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."" </p> <p>America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.</p>",2399,false,2017-11-26T14:45:18Z,UK,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24tya,false,true,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/20/obamasppech140x84.jpg,false,en,true,"My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.

But now, finally -- hard though it is to believe -- here it is. At around 11.30am today, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American to hold the office. (A little after 12.30, he'll escort George Bush to a waiting helicopter; might we assume there will be cheering?) The atmosphere in Washington DC this morning, where millions of people are gathering to share the moment, is electric: inaugurations are always quasi-religious affairs, but never in living memory has one been as freighted with meaning as this. The day's <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/obama-inauguration-timetable"">full schedule is here</a>; the Obamas have just arrived at the White House, where they're joining the Bushes and the <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2009/jan/20/obama-inauguration-dickcheney"">achy-backed</a> Dick Cheney and his wife for coffee, before proceeding to the capitol. Join me here imminently for history in the making, plus wisecracks. </p> <p><strong>10.05am</strong>: Here's how big the crowd is: the entire stretch of the Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol has now reportedly been closed. See the satellite image <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall"">here</a> for what a vast stretch of space that is: it's fourteen long city blocks, or more than a mile.</p>    <p><strong>10.11am</strong>: Bringing an official start to proceedings, we're now listening to the US Marine Band. I feel sorry for the flautists and the clarinettists, who have to wear fingerless gloves so that they can use their instruments. The bass drum guy has it so easy by comparison.</p> <p><strong>10.18am</strong>: Senior diplomatic and military types arrive to take their VIP seats on the Capitol steps. Nope, I've no idea who most of them are. Magic Johnson did arrive a little earlier, though. Everyone already looks very, very cold, and they've got plenty of time left to sit there getting colder. (Smugly, I've come back into the warmth -- it's the only way to follow the proceedings up close and to liveblog this thing -- but I was there just before and let me tell you it was freezing.)</p> <p><strong>10.26am</strong>: Ben Smith notes the audacity of French socialist politician Segolene Royal, who <a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0109/Royal_I_inspired_Obama.html"">this morning claims credit</a> for having inspired Obama. His team copied hers, she explains (except for the bit about winning). </p> <p><strong>10.33am</strong>: While we're waiting... an <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/19/MNFS15DBU9.DTL"">amusing inaugural fact</a> from 1829, when another ""people's president"", Andrew Jackson, tried to hold an ""open"" inauguration, albeit on a different scale to today's. ""About 20,000 people trample mud and horse manure into the White House, destroy rugs, break satin-covered chairs, smash crystal and china, and spill liquor. Fights break out, women faint and Jackson has to escape through a window. Order is restored when barrels of whiskey are placed on the South Lawn, drawing the crowd outside."" Back in 2009, senior congressional leaders are arriving on the steps.</p> <p><strong>10.37am</strong>: At the White House, the Obamas and the Bushes are finishing up their coffee -- what wouldn't you give to be a fly on the wall at that particular meeting? -- and any moment they'll enter two limousines, the men in one and the women in another, the departing president sitting on the right, the president-elect on the left. It's not a long journey from the White House to the Capitol, even when the roads aren't cleared and empty for you, so we'll expect to see them arrive minutes later. </p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong>: Many great comments below -- do read them. Ted Kennedy arrives, thereby answering the question of whether he'd be well enough to attend. John Kerry and George HW Bush follow on; it's a dignitary bonanza up there!</p> <p><strong>10.43am</strong>: Jill Biden and Lynn Cheney leave the White House and step into a waiting limo, followed by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. ... And Joe Biden and, in a wheelchair, Dick Cheney, who injured his back yesterday moving into his new home.</p> <p><strong>10.48am</strong>: Two significant moments, almost simultaneous: at one end of the city, at the Capitol, John McCain arrives to watch the man who defeated him get sworn in, and at the other, Obama and Bush step out to the north portico of the White House to loud cheers. (Who knew Bush was so well-loved?)</p>    <p><strong>10.53am</strong>: What must it be like to be Bush today, and to look down the Mall, as he will a little later, and see millions of people clamouring not only in support of your successor, but also for you to leave? I suspect Bush may be as relieved as anyone that he's leaving power today, but the man's internal life continues to baffle and fascinate. I don't mean to sound <em>sympathetic</em>, but...</p> <p><strong>10.59am</strong>: How they're <a href=""http://orissadiary.com/CurrentNews.asp?id=10231"">welcoming Obama</a> in Puri, India: a three-tonne sand sculpture.</p> <p><strong>11.05am</strong>: It's amusing, and rather touching, to see how many of the bigshot senators and other political figures are clutching digital cameras, snapping away, recording the moment.</p> <p><strong>11.08am</strong>: My colleague Richard Adams, who nabbed himself a good seat for today's events, and who is a show-off, texts to say he just ran into <a href=""http://www.alfranken.com/content/splash_recountBrief"">Al Franken</a> on the way to the bathroom, but that Franken was too busy to stop to have his photograph taken. He's doubtless using every last minute to <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17644.html"">raise funds</a> for his Minnesota court case. Meanwhile, Al and Tipper Gore arrive. [UPDATE: I misread Richard's text. This happened to someone sitting near him, not to him...]</p> <p><strong>11.17am</strong>: The Carters arrive... and the Clintons. And then someone <em>really</em> important, Rahm Emanuel, who will basically be the second most powerful person in the world within the hour. Meanwhile we learn that, following tradition, Bush <a href=""http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6220304.html"">left Obama a note in the White House</a>. ""The White House today declined to provide intimate details of the message the two-term Republican left for the incoming Democrat, saying only that Bush wrote it on Monday and left it in the top drawer of his desk."" Your guesses?</p> <p><strong>11.20am</strong>: <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/getthere/?hpid=topnews"">Chaos on the DC metro</a> as a woman falls from a platform onto the track, closing two major stations. (They've now reopened.) At the White House, currently unoccupied by any president, moving crews are unloading boxes of Obama's stuff -- it's <a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17665.html"">a lightning-fast operation</a>.</p> <p><strong>11.25am</strong>: Here are Sasha and Malia Obama, in blue and pink winter coats respectively, and a roar carries down the Mall -- first, the people who are close by, then those watching on screens a long way away. </p> <p><strong>11.31am</strong>: Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are in their seats. And now here's Bush arriving at the Capitol, looking oddly apprehensive. ""No more Bush! No more Bush!"" chant the crowd, though they haven't seen Bush on the jumbotron screens yet, I don't think.</p> <p><strong>11.37am</strong>: ...Aaaand Bush and Cheney are announced to a military fanfare, accompanied by congressional leaders, and now a rendition of Hail To The Chief. Up on the Capitol steps, it's all smiles and polite applause, of course. Not so up by the Washington Monument, I'll warrant.</p> <p><strong>11.39am</strong>: Biden is announced, to raucous flagwaving. Backstage, there's footage of Obama walking through the Capitol building, looking <em>even more</em> completely sober and calm than usual, which is saying something. Though on second thoughts, maybe there's something in the cast of his expression this morning that speaks of the pressure he's under. He seems to be holding himself in. Any moment now, he'll walk into the cold open air.</p> <p><strong>11.43am</strong>: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect of the United States, Barack H. Obama."" The Mall explodes. For a moment on the carpeted staircase, Obama looks very slight, small, and solitary. But it only lasts a moment; now he's back in his element, shaking hands and taking his seat.</p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong>: Dianne Feinstein takes to the podium for her call to order. ""The world is watching today as our great democracy engages in this peaceful transition of power... we gather to etch another line in the solid stone of history. The freedom of a people to choose its leaders is the root of liberty. In a world where political strife is too often settled with violence, we come here every four years to bestow the power of the presidency upon our democratically elected leader... Future generations will mark this morning as the turning-point for real and necessary change in our nation. They will look back and remember that this is the moment when the dream that once echoed across history from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial finally reached the walls of the White House.""</p> <p><strong>11.48am</strong>: Here's the controverial evangelical pastor Rick Warren to provide the invocation. The invocation won't be controversial, you can be sure, though. Eyes are closed up and down the Mall. (Obama's too.) ""We celebrate a hinge point of history, with the inauguration of our first African-American president of the United States. We are so grateful to live in this land... where the son of an African immigrant can rise to the highest levels of our leadership."" Dr King is ""shouting in heaven"" he says. ""Help us to remember that we are Americans related not by religion or race or blood but by our commitment to freedom and justice for all... We now commit our new president and his wife Michelle, and his daughters Malia and Sasha, into your loving care."" He concludes with the Lord's Prayer.</p> <p><strong>11.53am</strong>: They're going to have to get through the rest of the ceremony pretty fast: Biden has to be sworn in first, but in accordance with the constitution, Obama has to take the oath by noon at the latest. We're running a good 20-25 minutes late compared to the official announced schedule.</p> <p><strong>11.54am</strong>: And yet first here's Aretha Franklin, approaching the podium to sing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Country,_%27Tis_of_Thee"">My Country Tis Of Thee</a>, accompanied by the marine band. Which is, of course, our own beloved British national anthem. Only with different words. And, you know, better, when Aretha's singing it.</p> <p><strong>11.57am</strong>: Supreme court justice John Paul Stevens is introduced, to administer Biden's oath of office. Biden lays his hand on the bible. The oath: ""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" And thus America has a new vice-president. Biden does a little arms-wide ""how about that then?"" gesture; Bruce Springsteen chuckles. (Bruce Springsteen's chuckle is not a consitutional requirement.)</p> <p><strong>12 noon</strong>: It's noon, so I guess that means <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/01/19/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4734750.shtml?CMP=OTC-RSSFeed&amp;source=RSS&amp;attr=PoliticalHotsheet_4734750"">Robert Gates is president for a few minutes</a>? (UPDATE: No, it turns out. Bush is still president, Biden is vice-president. How weird is that? UPDATE II: Confusion reigns. Apparently it's Biden. Or maybe not.) The star-studded quartet of Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gabriela Montero and Anthony McGill are introduced. They're playing a selection of music arranged by John Williams, which lends an appropriately cinematic tenor to proceedings. (It's based around the Shaker song <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Gifts"">Simple Gifts</a>.)</p> <p><strong>12.04pm</strong>: And here's Obama, with Chief Justice John Roberts. Obama uses his full name, of course, as protocol dictates, but it's still somewhat extraordinary to remember that America just elected someone with the middle name Hussein. He stumbles slightly over the oath, actually, though it seemed that it was Roberts who stumbled first... but they get through it. And so here we are. You can imagine the scenes on the Mall.</p>    <p><strong>12.07pm</strong>: Obama takes the podium. ""Thank you, thank you... My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors."" Forty-four people have taken the oath, he says, but ""every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms... That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood"": war, economic crisis. ""And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.""</p> <p><strong>12.11pm</strong>: ""Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: they will be met.""</p> <p><strong>12.13pm</strong>: He praises ""the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things... time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions."" America is still the most prosperous nation on earth, he says, its minds no less inventive, ""our capacity... undiminished... But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions: that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.""</p> <p><strong>12.16pm</strong>: A pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place,"" and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Now he's rejecting the notion that this isn't a time for grand ambitions. ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them: the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply."" The question isn't big or small government, but whether government works; not whether the free market is good or bad but that it needs a ""watchful eye."" ""As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.""</p> <p><strong>12.18pm</strong>: ""And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more..."" America will ""begin responsibly to leave Iraq to its people"" and start to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet... [but] we will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you,"" because America's ""patchwork heritage"" is a strength, not a weakness. Pretty aggressive stuff. He mentions Americans' various religions, and also ""non-believers"": a first for an inaugural address? That's impressive.</p> <p><strong>12.21pm</strong>: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West: know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."" We can no longer afford to ignore ""suffering outside our borders,"" he says. ""Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect."" And more about the international community: a real internationalist focus here, which as a non-American I can't help finding some of the most rousing stuff. (I take the commentators' point, though, that Euroliberals would probably have condemned some of Obama's words on spreading the American ideal abroad if it had been uttered by George Bush as, indeed, it was, in his 2004 inaugural...) The sense of being somewhat stressed that was evident on Obama's face a little earlier has vanished; at this podium, it seems, is where he feels most at home. </p> <p><strong>12.24pm</strong>: And now the much-anticipated passage on personal responsibility. The whole speech, indeed, is notable for how much focus Obama's putting on seeking to buck Americans up, to stiffen their spines, to call them to action. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility: a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship... This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed... and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Huge, huge applause.</p> <p><strong>12.26pm</strong>: Building to a finale now, remembering George Washington's words in the harsh winter of 1776. ""In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.""</p> <p><strong>12.28pm</strong>: A long poem now by <a href=""http://www.elizabethalexander.net/home.html"">Elizabeth Alexander</a>. (I'll let others dissect it later.) The civil rights leader <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lowery"">Reverend Joseph Lowery</a> is here to deliver the benediction. (Only a few minutes until the Bush Helicopter Moment now!) ""Mend our brokenness, heal our wounds, and delivery us from the exploitation of the poor,"" Lowery asks God. ""...We walk together, pledging that we won't get weary in the difficult days ahead."" And then a rather unexpected rhyming riff about racial diversity and co-operation, which I missed and will post here as soon as I get hold of a copy. UPDATE: Here it is. Lowery called for the day ""when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white would embrace what is right."" So there.</p> <p><strong>12.39pm</strong>: The national anthem concludes this part of the proceedings, with hundreds of thousands on the Mall joining in -- although quite a few left immediately after the swearing-in, doubtless to avoid the crush. Bush and Obama move through the crowd together now. The helicopter awaits. The crowd on the Mall: are they ecstatic? Yes, they are ecstatic. </p> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong>: Obama and ""the former president Bush"" -- there are two of them, now! -- enter the Capitol building. They'll walk through it to the east side, where Marines line the staircase and a helicopter waits in the courtyard. The helicopter is Executive One; it's only Marine One when the president is inside it.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong>: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong>: The Obamas and Bushes emerge onto the steps and pose for photographs. I've got to say, Bush looks positively glowing now that it's all over. They're exchanging what looks like small talk. (What could it be?)</p> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong>: A positively jovial mood seems to prevail between the two men as they walk towards the helicopter flanked by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. A pat on the shoulder from Obama to Bush, words between George and Michelle, and then a final handshake between 43 and 44. The helicopter's staircases swing up and closed, leaving the Obamas and the Bidens on the east Capitol steps. The helicopter rotors start turning, blowing Michelle Obama's hair. </p> <p><strong>12.56pm</strong>: And Bush goes up and away; the helicopter grows small. There is, as you might imagine, quite a bit of cheering from the crowds on the Mall. Apparently the helicopter may go on a bit of scenic tour of DC, but it's headed ultimately to Andrews Air Force Base, whereupon the Bushes will board a plane for Texas. ""Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye,"" sing the spectators on the Mall.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong>: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far.</p> <p><strong>2.07pm</strong>: I had a chicken sandwich. Obama ate <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/01/so-whats-for-lu.html"">food from Lincoln's era</a>, although not technically one hopes. The menu is <a href=""http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/"">here</a>. Pheasant, duck, sour cherry chutney and molassses sweet potatoes, followed by apple cinnamon sponge cake.</p> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong>: They're still eating; Nancy Pelosi is addressing the diners. The crowds lining the parade route remain excitable. The inaugural parade is, well, a parade. The one genuinely intriguing question is whether, when, and for how long Obama will get out of his limousine and walk for part of the route along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Carter was the first president to <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/39_carter/index.html"">walk the entire route</a>, but security concerns mean that if Obama walks it'll almost certainly be just for a small portion of it.</p> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong>: ""Medical emergency reported at Congressional luncheon,"" MSNBC reports Ted Kennedy has been taken out of the luncheon on a stretcher. Obama is speaking to the diners now, and begins his remarks with words of praise for the Massachusetts senator. UPDATE: And 91-year-old Robert Byrd, who was ""<a href=""http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0109/Kennedy_and_Byrd_both_leave_lunch_with_medical_trouble.html"">removed in his wheelchair under the supervision of medical personnel</a>."" UPDATE II: Byrd's going to be OK, apparently, and the reports on Kennedy seem broadly upbeat, too.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong>: And the parade begins. The Obamas and the Bidens, looking exceptionally cold on the Capitol steps -- Michelle looks positively exhausted -- stand for a military march-past. There are many tubas. </p> <p><strong>3.24pm</strong>: The first couple enter <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7829475.stm"">the Beast</a>, the president's extraordinarily well-protected limousine, license plate USA1. Obama seems a little awkward saluting the various military personnel lining the route. The motorcade progresses at walking pace out of the Capitol grounds.</p> <p><strong>3.36pm</strong>: The limousine reaches the parade route, with tens of motorcycles, blue and red lights flashing, in the lead. The crowds lining the route -- only five or six deep at this point, because access is restricted -- whoop and scream.</p> <p><strong>4.03pm</strong>: Finally, as the motorcade reaches the Navy Memorial, the limousine slows to a halt -- not that it was going fast in the first place -- and the Obamas get out, several blocks earlier than planned, apparently. They're striding purposefully up Pennsylvania Avenue now, flanked by Secret Service personnel, waving at the onlookers. (We're running so far behind schedule now that the light is beginning to fade.) They're walking significantly faster than the car was travelling, by my reckoning. This administration can't be seen to be taking things easy.</p> <p><strong>4.11pm</strong>: And back into The Beast.</p> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong>: The motorcade approaches the White House, where the Obamas will take their positions in a heavily bulletproofed viewing stand to watch the passing parade. I'm going to wrap this up now, but if you've got access to TV coverage, you've got plenty of parading left to watch, should you so choose. What a day; what a moment to have witnessed. Thank you for reading and commenting. More post-inauguration blogging from me <a href=""http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman"">here</a> tomorrow.</p>",3889,false,2017-07-15T02:09:53Z,UK,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24ttb,false,true,NA,false,en,true,"10am (all times eastern): So much has been said and written about the significance of this moment. But now, finally -- hard though it is to believe -- here it is. At around 11.30am today, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American to hold the office. (A little after 12.30, he'll escort George Bush to a waiting helicopter; might we assume there will be cheering?) The atmosphere in Washington DC this morning, where millions of people are gathering to share the moment, is electric: inaugurations are always quasi-religious affairs, but never in living memory has one been as freighted with meaning as this. The day's full schedule is here; the Obamas have just arrived at the White House, where they're joining the Bushes and the achy-backed Dick Cheney and his wife for coffee, before proceeding to the capitol. Join me here imminently for history in the making, plus wisecracks. 10.05am: Here's how big the crowd is: the entire stretch of the Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol has now reportedly been closed. See the satellite image here for what a vast stretch of space that is: it's fourteen long city blocks, or more than a mile. 10.11am: Bringing an official start to proceedings, we're now listening to the US Marine Band. I feel sorry for the flautists and the clarinettists, who have to wear fingerless gloves so that they can use their instruments. The bass drum guy has it so easy by comparison. 10.18am: Senior diplomatic and military types arrive to take their VIP seats on the Capitol steps. Nope, I've no idea who most of them are. Magic Johnson did arrive a little earlier, though. Everyone already looks very, very cold, and they've got plenty of time left to sit there getting colder. (Smugly, I've come back into the warmth -- it's the only way to follow the proceedings up close and to liveblog this thing -- but I was there just before and let me tell you it was freezing.) 10.26am: Ben Smith notes the audacity of French socialist politician Segolene Royal, who this morning claims credit for having inspired Obama. His team copied hers, she explains (except for the bit about winning). 10.33am: While we're waiting... an amusing inaugural fact from 1829, when another ""people's president"", Andrew Jackson, tried to hold an ""open"" inauguration, albeit on a different scale to today's. ""About 20,000 people trample mud and horse manure into the White House, destroy rugs, break satin-covered chairs, smash crystal and china, and spill liquor. Fights break out, women faint and Jackson has to escape through a window. Order is restored when barrels of whiskey are placed on the South Lawn, drawing the crowd outside."" Back in 2009, senior congressional leaders are arriving on the steps. 10.37am: At the White House, the Obamas and the Bushes are finishing up their coffee -- what wouldn't you give to be a fly on the wall at that particular meeting? -- and any moment they'll enter two limousines, the men in one and the women in another, the departing president sitting on the right, the president-elect on the left. It's not a long journey from the White House to the Capitol, even when the roads aren't cleared and empty for you, so we'll expect to see them arrive minutes later. 10.40am: Many great comments below -- do read them. Ted Kennedy arrives, thereby answering the question of whether he'd be well enough to attend. John Kerry and George HW Bush follow on; it's a dignitary bonanza up there! 10.43am: Jill Biden and Lynn Cheney leave the White House and step into a waiting limo, followed by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. ... And Joe Biden and, in a wheelchair, Dick Cheney, who injured his back yesterday moving into his new home. 10.48am: Two significant moments, almost simultaneous: at one end of the city, at the Capitol, John McCain arrives to watch the man who defeated him get sworn in, and at the other, Obama and Bush step out to the north portico of the White House to loud cheers. (Who knew Bush was so well-loved?) 10.53am: What must it be like to be Bush today, and to look down the Mall, as he will a little later, and see millions of people clamouring not only in support of your successor, but also for you to leave? I suspect Bush may be as relieved as anyone that he's leaving power today, but the man's internal life continues to baffle and fascinate. I don't mean to sound sympathetic, but... 10.59am: How they're welcoming Obama in Puri, India: a three-tonne sand sculpture. 11.05am: It's amusing, and rather touching, to see how many of the bigshot senators and other political figures are clutching digital cameras, snapping away, recording the moment. 11.08am: My colleague Richard Adams, who nabbed himself a good seat for today's events, and who is a show-off, texts to say he just ran into Al Franken on the way to the bathroom, but that Franken was too busy to stop to have his photograph taken. He's doubtless using every last minute to raise funds for his Minnesota court case. Meanwhile, Al and Tipper Gore arrive. [UPDATE: I misread Richard's text. This happened to someone sitting near him, not to him...] 11.17am: The Carters arrive... and the Clintons. And then someone really important, Rahm Emanuel, who will basically be the second most powerful person in the world within the hour. Meanwhile we learn that, following tradition, Bush left Obama a note in the White House. ""The White House today declined to provide intimate details of the message the two-term Republican left for the incoming Democrat, saying only that Bush wrote it on Monday and left it in the top drawer of his desk."" Your guesses? 11.20am: Chaos on the DC metro as a woman falls from a platform onto the track, closing two major stations. (They've now reopened.) At the White House, currently unoccupied by any president, moving crews are unloading boxes of Obama's stuff -- it's a lightning-fast operation. 11.25am: Here are Sasha and Malia Obama, in blue and pink winter coats respectively, and a roar carries down the Mall -- first, the people who are close by, then those watching on screens a long way away. 11.31am: Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are in their seats. And now here's Bush arriving at the Capitol, looking oddly apprehensive. ""No more Bush! No more Bush!"" chant the crowd, though they haven't seen Bush on the jumbotron screens yet, I don't think. 11.37am: ...Aaaand Bush and Cheney are announced to a military fanfare, accompanied by congressional leaders, and now a rendition of Hail To The Chief. Up on the Capitol steps, it's all smiles and polite applause, of course. Not so up by the Washington Monument, I'll warrant. 11.39am: Biden is announced, to raucous flagwaving. Backstage, there's footage of Obama walking through the Capitol building, looking even more completely sober and calm than usual, which is saying something. Though on second thoughts, maybe there's something in the cast of his expression this morning that speaks of the pressure he's under. He seems to be holding himself in. Any moment now, he'll walk into the cold open air. 11.43am: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect of the United States, Barack H. Obama."" The Mall explodes. For a moment on the carpeted staircase, Obama looks very slight, small, and solitary. But it only lasts a moment; now he's back in his element, shaking hands and taking his seat. 11.45am: Dianne Feinstein takes to the podium for her call to order. ""The world is watching today as our great democracy engages in this peaceful transition of power... we gather to etch another line in the solid stone of history. The freedom of a people to choose its leaders is the root of liberty. In a world where political strife is too often settled with violence, we come here every four years to bestow the power of the presidency upon our democratically elected leader... Future generations will mark this morning as the turning-point for real and necessary change in our nation. They will look back and remember that this is the moment when the dream that once echoed across history from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial finally reached the walls of the White House."" 11.48am: Here's the controverial evangelical pastor Rick Warren to provide the invocation. The invocation won't be controversial, you can be sure, though. Eyes are closed up and down the Mall. (Obama's too.) ""We celebrate a hinge point of history, with the inauguration of our first African-American president of the United States. We are so grateful to live in this land... where the son of an African immigrant can rise to the highest levels of our leadership."" Dr King is ""shouting in heaven"" he says. ""Help us to remember that we are Americans related not by religion or race or blood but by our commitment to freedom and justice for all... We now commit our new president and his wife Michelle, and his daughters Malia and Sasha, into your loving care."" He concludes with the Lord's Prayer. 11.53am: They're going to have to get through the rest of the ceremony pretty fast: Biden has to be sworn in first, but in accordance with the constitution, Obama has to take the oath by noon at the latest. We're running a good 20-25 minutes late compared to the official announced schedule. 11.54am: And yet first here's Aretha Franklin, approaching the podium to sing My Country Tis Of Thee, accompanied by the marine band. Which is, of course, our own beloved British national anthem. Only with different words. And, you know, better, when Aretha's singing it. 11.57am: Supreme court justice John Paul Stevens is introduced, to administer Biden's oath of office. Biden lays his hand on the bible. The oath: ""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" And thus America has a new vice-president. Biden does a little arms-wide ""how about that then?"" gesture; Bruce Springsteen chuckles. (Bruce Springsteen's chuckle is not a consitutional requirement.) 12 noon: It's noon, so I guess that means Robert Gates is president for a few minutes? (UPDATE: No, it turns out. Bush is still president, Biden is vice-president. How weird is that? UPDATE II: Confusion reigns. Apparently it's Biden. Or maybe not.) The star-studded quartet of Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gabriela Montero and Anthony McGill are introduced. They're playing a selection of music arranged by John Williams, which lends an appropriately cinematic tenor to proceedings. (It's based around the Shaker song Simple Gifts.) 12.04pm: And here's Obama, with Chief Justice John Roberts. Obama uses his full name, of course, as protocol dictates, but it's still somewhat extraordinary to remember that America just elected someone with the middle name Hussein. He stumbles slightly over the oath, actually, though it seemed that it was Roberts who stumbled first... but they get through it. And so here we are. You can imagine the scenes on the Mall. 12.07pm: Obama takes the podium. ""Thank you, thank you... My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors."" Forty-four people have taken the oath, he says, but ""every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms... That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood"": war, economic crisis. ""And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."" 12.11pm: ""Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: they will be met."" 12.13pm: He praises ""the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things... time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions."" America is still the most prosperous nation on earth, he says, its minds no less inventive, ""our capacity... undiminished... But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions: that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."" 12.16pm: A pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place,"" and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Now he's rejecting the notion that this isn't a time for grand ambitions. ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them: the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply."" The question isn't big or small government, but whether government works; not whether the free market is good or bad but that it needs a ""watchful eye."" ""As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" 12.18pm: ""And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more..."" America will ""begin responsibly to leave Iraq to its people"" and start to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet... [but] we will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you,"" because America's ""patchwork heritage"" is a strength, not a weakness. Pretty aggressive stuff. He mentions Americans' various religions, and also ""non-believers"": a first for an inaugural address? That's impressive. 12.21pm: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West: know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."" We can no longer afford to ignore ""suffering outside our borders,"" he says. ""Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect."" And more about the international community: a real internationalist focus here, which as a non-American I can't help finding some of the most rousing stuff. (I take the commentators' point, though, that Euroliberals would probably have condemned some of Obama's words on spreading the American ideal abroad if it had been uttered by George Bush as, indeed, it was, in his 2004 inaugural...) The sense of being somewhat stressed that was evident on Obama's face a little earlier has vanished; at this podium, it seems, is where he feels most at home. 12.24pm: And now the much-anticipated passage on personal responsibility. The whole speech, indeed, is notable for how much focus Obama's putting on seeking to buck Americans up, to stiffen their spines, to call them to action. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility: a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship... This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed... and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Huge, huge applause. 12.26pm: Building to a finale now, remembering George Washington's words in the harsh winter of 1776. ""In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America."" 12.28pm: A long poem now by Elizabeth Alexander. (I'll let others dissect it later.) The civil rights leader Reverend Joseph Lowery is here to deliver the benediction. (Only a few minutes until the Bush Helicopter Moment now!) ""Mend our brokenness, heal our wounds, and delivery us from the exploitation of the poor,"" Lowery asks God. ""...We walk together, pledging that we won't get weary in the difficult days ahead."" And then a rather unexpected rhyming riff about racial diversity and co-operation, which I missed and will post here as soon as I get hold of a copy. UPDATE: Here it is. Lowery called for the day ""when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white would embrace what is right."" So there. 12.39pm: The national anthem concludes this part of the proceedings, with hundreds of thousands on the Mall joining in -- although quite a few left immediately after the swearing-in, doubtless to avoid the crush. Bush and Obama move through the crowd together now. The helicopter awaits. The crowd on the Mall: are they ecstatic? Yes, they are ecstatic. 12.47pm: Obama and ""the former president Bush"" -- there are two of them, now! -- enter the Capitol building. They'll walk through it to the east side, where Marines line the staircase and a helicopter waits in the courtyard. The helicopter is Executive One; it's only Marine One when the president is inside it. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 12.50pm: The Obamas and Bushes emerge onto the steps and pose for photographs. I've got to say, Bush looks positively glowing now that it's all over. They're exchanging what looks like small talk. (What could it be?) 12.52pm: A positively jovial mood seems to prevail between the two men as they walk towards the helicopter flanked by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. A pat on the shoulder from Obama to Bush, words between George and Michelle, and then a final handshake between 43 and 44. The helicopter's staircases swing up and closed, leaving the Obamas and the Bidens on the east Capitol steps. The helicopter rotors start turning, blowing Michelle Obama's hair. 12.56pm: And Bush goes up and away; the helicopter grows small. There is, as you might imagine, quite a bit of cheering from the crowds on the Mall. Apparently the helicopter may go on a bit of scenic tour of DC, but it's headed ultimately to Andrews Air Force Base, whereupon the Bushes will board a plane for Texas. ""Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye,"" sing the spectators on the Mall. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 2.07pm: I had a chicken sandwich. Obama ate food from Lincoln's era, although not technically one hopes. The menu is here. Pheasant, duck, sour cherry chutney and molassses sweet potatoes, followed by apple cinnamon sponge cake. 2.41pm: They're still eating; Nancy Pelosi is addressing the diners. The crowds lining the parade route remain excitable. The inaugural parade is, well, a parade. The one genuinely intriguing question is whether, when, and for how long Obama will get out of his limousine and walk for part of the route along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Carter was the first president to walk the entire route, but security concerns mean that if Obama walks it'll almost certainly be just for a small portion of it. 2.51pm: ""Medical emergency reported at Congressional luncheon,"" MSNBC reports Ted Kennedy has been taken out of the luncheon on a stretcher. Obama is speaking to the diners now, and begins his remarks with words of praise for the Massachusetts senator. UPDATE: And 91-year-old Robert Byrd, who was ""removed in his wheelchair under the supervision of medical personnel."" UPDATE II: Byrd's going to be OK, apparently, and the reports on Kennedy seem broadly upbeat, too. 3.20pm: And the parade begins. The Obamas and the Bidens, looking exceptionally cold on the Capitol steps -- Michelle looks positively exhausted -- stand for a military march-past. There are many tubas. 3.24pm: The first couple enter the Beast, the president's extraordinarily well-protected limousine, license plate USA1. Obama seems a little awkward saluting the various military personnel lining the route. The motorcade progresses at walking pace out of the Capitol grounds. 3.36pm: The limousine reaches the parade route, with tens of motorcycles, blue and red lights flashing, in the lead. The crowds lining the route -- only five or six deep at this point, because access is restricted -- whoop and scream. 4.03pm: Finally, as the motorcade reaches the Navy Memorial, the limousine slows to a halt -- not that it was going fast in the first place -- and the Obamas get out, several blocks earlier than planned, apparently. They're striding purposefully up Pennsylvania Avenue now, flanked by Secret Service personnel, waving at the onlookers. (We're running so far behind schedule now that the light is beginning to fade.) They're walking significantly faster than the car was travelling, by my reckoning. This administration can't be seen to be taking things easy. 4.11pm: And back into The Beast. 4.15pm: The motorcade approaches the White House, where the Obamas will take their positions in a heavily bulletproofed viewing stand to watch the passing parade. I'm going to wrap this up now, but if you've got access to TV coverage, you've got plenty of parading left to watch, should you so choose. What a day; what a moment to have witnessed.

I stand here today humbled by the task before us,"" he said, ""Every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms."" Those storms are the metaphorical tempests on the global markets, but they are also the gales that will literally result from climate instability caused by rising CO2 emissions.</p> <p>Obama hinted that the Bush administration's championing of fossil fuels had created grave problems – both climatic and geopolitical. ""The ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and endanger our planet,"" he said, referring presumably to Middle Eastern oil. But ultimately, his message was one of hope. The challenges the country faces will are not insurmountable, he said. ""Know this America, they will be met,"" he said, ""On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear.""</p> <p>""We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth… Our capacity remains undiminished,"" he added.</p> <p>Today was not a day for detailed solutions to the climate change threat or for a policy-wonk's guide to the new green economy that Obama promised on the campaign trail. That hard graft begins later. But there was a statement of intent that scientific and environmental issues would occupy a renewed place in the Oval Office. ""We will restore science to its rightful place,"" he said, ""We will harness the sun and the wind and the soil to fuel our cars.""</p> <p>Before the inaugaration, Obama had already <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jan/12/barack-obama-science-advisers-climate-change"" title="""">delighted scientists and environmentalists with his choice of green-minded scientists</a> that will join his administration and his professed attitude to scientific evidence. He has emphasised the need to listen to scientists, ""especially when it is inconvenient"". In a signal of this renewed respect for evidence he has restored the authority of the president's science advisor to the White House. Obama's pick for the position, <a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/john-holdren"" title="""">John Holdren</a>, professor of environmental policy at the <a href=""http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/leadership/"" title="""">John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University</a>, has been uncompromising in his warnings about the threat posed by climate change (he dislikes the phrase ""global warming"" because it he says oversimplifies the nature of the problem).</p> <p>The new president has invited <a href=""http://lucile.science.oregonstate.edu/lubchenco/Pages/AboutJane/Biography.cfm"" title="""">Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University</a> to become head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the government agency that studies the climate and monitors the health of marine ecosystems. She has been a powerful advocate for action on climate change.

After a stammering through the oath of office, the subtext of the gritty speech was that it would be hard – very hard – but America had the resourcefulness to reinvent itself. The new president's commitment to his environmental agenda shone through the dour images of a world economy in crisis with references to ""rolling back"" global warming through transforming the way America uses energy by harnessing ""the sun and the wind and the soil"". ""My fellow citizens. I stand here today humbled by the task before us,"" he said, ""Every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms."" Those storms are the metaphorical tempests on the global markets, but they are also the gales that will literally result from climate instability caused by rising CO2 emissions. Obama hinted that the Bush administration's championing of fossil fuels had created grave problems – both climatic and geopolitical. ""The ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and endanger our planet,"" he said, referring presumably to Middle Eastern oil. But ultimately, his message was one of hope. The challenges the country faces will are not insurmountable, he said. ""Know this America, they will be met,"" he said, ""On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear."" ""We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth… Our capacity remains undiminished,"" he added. Today was not a day for detailed solutions to the climate change threat or for a policy-wonk's guide to the new green economy that Obama promised on the campaign trail. That hard graft begins later. But there was a statement of intent that scientific and environmental issues would occupy a renewed place in the Oval Office. ""We will restore science to its rightful place,"" he said, ""We will harness the sun and the wind and the soil to fuel our cars."" Before the inaugaration, Obama had already delighted scientists and environmentalists with his choice of green-minded scientists that will join his administration and his professed attitude to scientific evidence. He has emphasised the need to listen to scientists, ""especially when it is inconvenient"". In a signal of this renewed respect for evidence he has restored the authority of the president's science advisor to the White House. Obama's pick for the position, John Holdren, professor of environmental policy at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has been uncompromising in his warnings about the threat posed by climate change (he dislikes the phrase ""global warming"" because it he says oversimplifies the nature of the problem). The new president has invited Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University to become head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the government agency that studies the climate and monitors the health of marine ecosystems. She has been a powerful advocate for action on climate change. Obama has also received plaudits for his pick of Nobel prizewinning physicist Steven Chu for energy secretary. During the campaign, Obama committed himself to a $150bn investment over the next decade in green energy. He wants to put 1m plug-in hybrid cars, with a fuel consumption of 150 miles per gallon, on the road by 2015. He also pledged that 10% of US electricity supplies should come from renewable sources by 2012 and 25% by 2025. He also signalled an intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. He will be under pressure to make good on these commitments and quickly. In his closing statements, President Obama pledged to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet"". But his message was even more fundamental than just changing the way the US and world uses energy. ""We can no longer afford indifference to the suffering that occurs outside our borders. Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to the effect,"" he said. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility… This is the price and promise of citizenship.""

What Barack Obama said today was that the story of American freedom is social history – the stuff of ordinary people's lives. The gist of Obama's argument during the campaign was that the trouble with our politics was that it had nothing to do with what was actually happening in people's lives. Struggles in cities and towns around the country seemed to have nothing to do with action in Washington, as if it were another country's capital. David Frum, New Majority One thing to learn from that speech – Obama is adjusting to his new role. He has learned that he must delegate even his own writing, which cannot have been easy. I feel sure that speech was not the personal work of this highly eloquent man. It takes a team of highly trained professionals to produce something quite so flat! it seems to evoke every oft-expressed thought and repeat so many well-worn phrases. Andrew Sullivan, The Daily Dish Emotionally, it spoke for itself. I cannot deny there are tears in my eyes. Intellectually, this struck me as the core point: ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them – that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works. The ability to put behind the ideologies of the recent past in order to regain the values of American history is the core message, it seems to me. He was arguing that we need to think again, to put aside childish things, and that this is the mark of responsibility and adulthood. Jacob Heilbrunn, Huffington Post He promised a new American revolution. His evocation of George Washington at the end of his address made it clear that he regards the perils that face the country as almost no less daunting than those that it confronted in battling for its independence. Obama's inaugural address, sober and dignified, has set the foundation for constructing a new gleaming edifice of democracy. It is up to us as much as Obama to construct it. Roger Simon, Politico He looked very serious, almost sombre, throughout his inaugural ceremony. And as he has done repeatedly in the last few weeks, he listed the barriers America faces, the mountains we have yet to climb. Will any of these words someday be carved in marble? That depends not on the words, but on the presidency. Nobody remembers the words of failed administrations. Robert Kaiser, Washington Post A memorable inaugural address. There haven't been many in my experience. Obama clearly wrote this one, as any reader of his books could immediately attest. I was also struck by the shots he took at Bush, with the outgoing president sitting right there. Think how Bush heard this line: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.""",2990,NA,NA,false,2009-01-20,NA,NA

Obama's serious tone and his unflinching acknowledgement of the economic hurricane blowing through America echoed Roosevelt's speech at the time of the last serious global depression, in which an incoming president vowed ""to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly … with a candour … which the present situation of our nation impels"". The endless crowd listened solemnly to the same sentiments today. They might have come wishing for something more uplifting, but, for many, the day reached beyond symbolism to a moment of genuine transformation after which nothing could be the same again. As Obama headed back into the Capitol building at the end of the ceremony clouds began rolling over what had until then been a pure blue sky. But there was one final, rousing cheer as the helicopter carrying George W Bush rose over the gleaming dome of government and took the former president off to Texas – and out of public life for ever.",5946,Alan Rusbridger in Washington,1,false,2009-01-21,"<span data-tag-id=""15314"" class=""contributor"">Alan Rusbridger</span> in Washington",NA

He was neither - until 22 December when his number came up.</p> <p>""Getting this ticket was exactly like winning the lottery,"" Gonzalez said. ""I've never won anything before."" </p> <p>Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans who will witness the final stage of Obama's journey down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, Gonzalez's trip to Washington is, in its own way, as improbable as the president's.</p> <p>Gonzalez knew no one in Washington, and could barely afford the air fare let alone the inflated rates of hotel rooms in inauguration week. He had to spend 10 hours a day preparing a lesson plan for the teacher who would take over his classes at a school in a poor area of Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p> <p>But yesterday saw Gonzalez and his partner, Phelosha Collaros, wheeling their luggage through a congressional office building, just east of the spot where Barack Obama will take the oath, inauguration tickets in hand.</p> <p>Collaros videoed every step of their journey for a short course Gonzalez will teach on his return. ""My students are way way out in New Mexico,"" he said. ""Most of them will never get a chance to come to Washington in their lives, so I feel a duty to bring something back to them.""</p> <p>A few blocks west, beneath the steps of the Capitol, Ekilah Poles, in orange gloves and furry hat, posed with her friends for photographs in front of a huge screen reading: ""44th president"".</p> <p>Poles reckoned yesterday was her best chance to see what Obama will </p> <p>see when he takes the oath on the </p> <p>steps of a Capitol draped with flags. </p> <p>She drove eight hours from Columbia, South Carolina to be in Washington, </p> <p>but does not have a ticket to the ceremony. ""I will be with my brethren on the mall,"" she said.</p> <p>Poles realises that Obama comes to office lumbered with expectations. But all she really wants is for him to connect with ordinary Americans. ""He is not going to be able to work miracles, but I expect him to tell us what hardships we are facing, and how he is going to get us through,"" she said. ""We don't necessarily have to agree.""</p> <p>Tim Andersen and Irina Kushner, lawyers who live in the Virginia suburbs, hurried along through the first flakes of snow. They wanted their view of history in advance. ""It's going to be too hectic dealing with everything and the road closures,"" said Andersen.</p> <p>Others could scarcely stay away, like the six students in Washington for just 10 days before leaving on an exchange programme to Tanzania, who congregated in front of the FBI headquarters, about halfway along Obama's route today.</p> <p>""This is crazy exciting,"" said Claire Richard, a student from Oklahoma. ""It's really touched people. My grandmother who is 96 is so jazzed.""</p> <p>Phil and Tracie Davis, bankers from Charlotte, North Carolina, were on a dry run with their daughter, Ariel, three. ""We just want to get a sense of how she is going to do in the crowds,"" said Tracie. </p> <p>The couple had paid over the odds for a hotel room near the parade route, but did not manage to find tickets to the inauguration. No matter. ""We just came to soak it all in and so she will have a story to tell her grandchildren."" </p> <p>For guests with the means to secure a room at the luxury Willard hotel, the atmosphere will come to them. It is a mere two blocks from the White House and offers a prime view of the parade route. Anna Oginsky, who is from Michigan, booked rooms for her husband and three young children and her mother last October, even before Obama was elected. ""I just knew it was going to happen,"" she said. </p> <p>That sense of anticipation was building as the day wore on, and further west along Pennsylvania Avenue to </p> <p>No 1600, the address of the White House, the viewing stand, with its blue presidential seal and Plexiglass windows, where Obama will watch the parade in his honour, is complete. The stands for dignitaries have gone up.</p> <p>A few reminders of the George Bush era remain - such as the protester shrouded in black with a sign reading: ""You boys sure know how to throw a bloodbath."" But by noon today, when Obama officially takes over as president, all that will be swept away.</p> <p>So too will Charlene Andrews's feeling of indifference towards the city where she was born and raised. For the first time, Andrews, 40, intends to see an inauguration with her own eyes, and to take her son, Caleb, nine.</p> <p>The cafeteria of her workplace, a federal courthouse, has a magnificent view of the Capitol.

He was neither - until 22 December when his number came up. ""Getting this ticket was exactly like winning the lottery,"" Gonzalez said. ""I've never won anything before."" Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans who will witness the final stage of Obama's journey down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, Gonzalez's trip to Washington is, in its own way, as improbable as the president's. Gonzalez knew no one in Washington, and could barely afford the air fare let alone the inflated rates of hotel rooms in inauguration week. He had to spend 10 hours a day preparing a lesson plan for the teacher who would take over his classes at a school in a poor area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. But yesterday saw Gonzalez and his partner, Phelosha Collaros, wheeling their luggage through a congressional office building, just east of the spot where Barack Obama will take the oath, inauguration tickets in hand. Collaros videoed every step of their journey for a short course Gonzalez will teach on his return. ""My students are way way out in New Mexico,"" he said. ""Most of them will never get a chance to come to Washington in their lives, so I feel a duty to bring something back to them."" A few blocks west, beneath the steps of the Capitol, Ekilah Poles, in orange gloves and furry hat, posed with her friends for photographs in front of a huge screen reading: ""44th president"". Poles reckoned yesterday was her best chance to see what Obama will see when he takes the oath on the steps of a Capitol draped with flags. She drove eight hours from Columbia, South Carolina to be in Washington, but does not have a ticket to the ceremony. ""I will be with my brethren on the mall,"" she said. Poles realises that Obama comes to office lumbered with expectations. But all she really wants is for him to connect with ordinary Americans. ""He is not going to be able to work miracles, but I expect him to tell us what hardships we are facing, and how he is going to get us through,"" she said. ""We don't necessarily have to agree."" Tim Andersen and Irina Kushner, lawyers who live in the Virginia suburbs, hurried along through the first flakes of snow. They wanted their view of history in advance. ""It's going to be too hectic dealing with everything and the road closures,"" said Andersen. Others could scarcely stay away, like the six students in Washington for just 10 days before leaving on an exchange programme to Tanzania, who congregated in front of the FBI headquarters, about halfway along Obama's route today. ""This is crazy exciting,"" said Claire Richard, a student from Oklahoma. ""It's really touched people. My grandmother who is 96 is so jazzed."" Phil and Tracie Davis, bankers from Charlotte, North Carolina, were on a dry run with their daughter, Ariel, three. ""We just want to get a sense of how she is going to do in the crowds,"" said Tracie. The couple had paid over the odds for a hotel room near the parade route, but did not manage to find tickets to the inauguration. No matter. ""We just came to soak it all in and so she will have a story to tell her grandchildren."" For guests with the means to secure a room at the luxury Willard hotel, the atmosphere will come to them. It is a mere two blocks from the White House and offers a prime view of the parade route. Anna Oginsky, who is from Michigan, booked rooms for her husband and three young children and her mother last October, even before Obama was elected. ""I just knew it was going to happen,"" she said. That sense of anticipation was building as the day wore on, and further west along Pennsylvania Avenue to No 1600, the address of the White House, the viewing stand, with its blue presidential seal and Plexiglass windows, where Obama will watch the parade in his honour, is complete. The stands for dignitaries have gone up. A few reminders of the George Bush era remain - such as the protester shrouded in black with a sign reading: ""You boys sure know how to throw a bloodbath."" But by noon today, when Obama officially takes over as president, all that will be swept away. So too will Charlene Andrews's feeling of indifference towards the city where she was born and raised. For the first time, Andrews, 40, intends to see an inauguration with her own eyes, and to take her son, Caleb, nine. The cafeteria of her workplace, a federal courthouse, has a magnificent view of the Capitol. ""I never felt a connection before,"" she said. ""I guess we take our city for granted, the fact that all this is around us."" Today that changes for the Andrews. ""This is so exciting,"" she said.

Approximately 3,660 miles away from the White House, the champagne was giddily sloshing, alongside the occasional latte grande. </p> <p>Elisabeth Murdoch, her husband, PR maestro Matthew Freud, and Ruth Rogers, proprieter of the dining room for everyone important, The River Cafe in London, pooled together their impressive address books to organise an inauguration party, which was held this afternoon. Where? In Notting Hill, of course, an area of London that increasingly seems to exist purely for Americans. Aptly, if inevitably, among the guests was director Richard Curtis, who pretty much sold the area to foreigners with his cinematic ode to the area, Notting Hill, which depicted an unlikely Anglo-American love affair. </p> <p>And that transatlantic adoration was in full flow in the Electric Cinema on Portobello Road.

Approximately 3,660 miles away from the White House, the champagne was giddily sloshing, alongside the occasional latte grande. Elisabeth Murdoch, her husband, PR maestro Matthew Freud, and Ruth Rogers, proprieter of the dining room for everyone important, The River Cafe in London, pooled together their impressive address books to organise an inauguration party, which was held this afternoon. Where? In Notting Hill, of course, an area of London that increasingly seems to exist purely for Americans. Aptly, if inevitably, among the guests was director Richard Curtis, who pretty much sold the area to foreigners with his cinematic ode to the area, Notting Hill, which depicted an unlikely Anglo-American love affair. And that transatlantic adoration was in full flow in the Electric Cinema on Portobello Road.

I think most of us expected the former from Barack Hussein Obama, whose most stirring oratories have certainly sung with ageless poetry.

A few of the lines were so on-message that they would have worked well in a closing statement during a presidential debate.</p> <p>There is precedent for this. Franklin Roosevelt's inaugural addresses, his first and second ones in particular, were pitched directly at the moment Americans faced then. That we are in the midst of an economic crisis greater than any since Roosevelt's time obviously motivated Obama to move his rhetoric in this direction.

""As for our common defense,"" he said, ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" The line drew a big cheer from the nearly two-million-strong Obama enthusiasts on the mall, and they knew exactly what he meant: no more Guantanamos, no more torture, no more Dick Cheney-style governance (and the sight of Cheney in that wheelchair…what was he doing packing his own boxes anyway?). And how about the line about how America's founding fathers ""understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please?"" Obama may be ready to cooperate with congressional Republicans, as he has often stated, but it has to be said that at least with regard to Bush and Cheney, even Obama's penchant for post-partisanship clearly has its limits.</p> <p>The speech's most stirring passages were directed not to Americans but to the world, and here, I think the speech was more in line with the high expectations. Here, he moved away from Roosevelt and leaned more on John Kennedy's 1961 address. His words ""to the people of poor nations"" were moving, and those addressed ""to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent"" were stern.

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","<p>When Barack Obama steps up to the podium to deliver his inaugural address, one man standing anonymously in the crowd will be paying especially close attention. With his cropped hair, five o'clock shadow and boyish face, he might look out of place among the dignitaries, though as co-author of the speech this man has more claim than most to be a witness to this moment of history.</p> <p>Jon Favreau, 27, is, as Obama himself puts it, the president's mind reader. He is one of the youngest chief speechwriters on record in the White House, and, despite such youth, was at the centre of discussions of the content of today's speech, one which has so much riding on it.</p> <p>For a politician whose rise to prominence was largely built upon his powers as an orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of speech-making. But today's effort will tower over all previous ones.</p> <p>It is not just that Obama has set an extremely high bar by invoking the inaugural speeches of Abraham Lincoln as his inspiration - admitting to feeling ""intimidated"" when he read them. It is also that, as he begins his term with the US in an economic crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to kick start his presidency with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and motivates the American people.</p> <p>The tone of the speech could be decisive in determining how the public responds to his first 100 days, as Franklin Roosevelt's famous line ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" helped to determine his.</p> <p>Obama aides have let it be known that a key theme will be restoring responsibility - both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved.

With his cropped hair, five o'clock shadow and boyish face, he might look out of place among the dignitaries, though as co-author of the speech this man has more claim than most to be a witness to this moment of history. Jon Favreau, 27, is, as Obama himself puts it, the president's mind reader. He is one of the youngest chief speechwriters on record in the White House, and, despite such youth, was at the centre of discussions of the content of today's speech, one which has so much riding on it. For a politician whose rise to prominence was largely built upon his powers as an orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of speech-making. But today's effort will tower over all previous ones. It is not just that Obama has set an extremely high bar by invoking the inaugural speeches of Abraham Lincoln as his inspiration - admitting to feeling ""intimidated"" when he read them. It is also that, as he begins his term with the US in an economic crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to kick start his presidency with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and motivates the American people. The tone of the speech could be decisive in determining how the public responds to his first 100 days, as Franklin Roosevelt's famous line ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" helped to determine his. Obama aides have let it be known that a key theme will be restoring responsibility - both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, talks of a ""culture of responsibility"" that would ""not just be asked of the American people; its leaders must also lead by example.""

There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America.

I'm not talking about blind optimism here - the almost wilful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!</p> <h2>On black community responsibilities</h2> <p><strong>1 May 2005</strong><br><strong>National Association for Advancement of Colored People, Detroit</strong></p> <p>Our grandparents used to tell us that being black means you have to work twice as hard to succeed in life. And so I ask today, can we honestly say our kids are working twice as hard as the kids in India and China who are graduating ahead of us, with better test scores and the tools they need to kick our butts on the job market? Can we honestly say our teachers are working twice as hard, or our parents?</p> <h2>In defence of women's right to choose</h2> <p><strong>10 November 2005</strong><br><strong>National Women's Law Centre, Washington</strong></p> <p>The other side knows that equal opportunity has always been a winning argument for us. And that's why those who don't want to make it a reality choose to fight on other terms. They make sure that in any given campaign or debate, the only woman's issue that ever comes up is not equal pay or healthcare or family leave, but the narrowest, most divisive issues like late-term abortion.</p> <p>Now, the ability for a woman to make decisions about how many children to have and when - without interference from the government - is one of the most fundamental freedoms we have. We all know, becoming a parent is one of the most - if not the most - important jobs there is. No one should make that decision for a woman and her family but them. And we must keep defending their right to make this choice in the years to come.</p> <h2>On ending America's fossil fuel addiction</h2> <p><strong>3 April 2006</strong><br><strong>Chicago</strong></p> <p>When it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change is coming from the very people who are running the country.</p> <p>By now, the Bush administration's record on climate change is almost legendary. This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans. This is the administration that didn't try to improve the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to stem climate change. And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a Nasa scientist for letting the rest of us know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal ...</p> <p>This is not a serious effort. Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program. It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it.</p> <h2>The challenge of going into politics, with 'that funny name'</h2> <p><strong>11 May 2006</strong><br><strong>Emily's List annual lunch, Washington</strong></p> <p>I remember when I first ran for the state senate - my very first race. A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running. Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.</p> <p>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.</p> <p>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature. And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:</p> <p>First, they'd ask, ""Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"" Because people just couldn't pronounce it. They'd call me ""Alabama,"" or they'd call me ""Yo Mama"". And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.</p> <p>And the second thing people would ask me was, ""You seem like a nice young man. You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organise voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?""</p> <h2>On the embarrassment of his first Democratic convention</h2> <p><strong>2 June 2006</strong><br><strong>University of Massachusetts, Boston</strong></p> <p>It's always great to be back in Boston. As some of you may have heard, I was here a few years ago to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention.</p> <p>It was an amazing experience for me. A humbling honour. A tremendous opportunity. And if you had come up to me a few years earlier and told me I'd be there, I would've politely told you that you were out of your mind.</p> <p>Let me tell you what happened at the last convention I had been to.</p> <p>It was the year 2000, and I had just gotten my rear-end handed to me in my very first race for Congress. Didn't even make it past the primary. I was a little depressed, and more than a little broke, but some friends suggested that I get my mind off it by going to Los Angeles, where that year's Democratic convention was being held.</p> <p>So I decided to go. And when my plane landed in LA, I got my luggage, walked on over to the Hertz counter, filled out all the forms to rent a car, gave my credit card to the nice woman behind the counter who, moments later, handed it back to me and said, ""Mr Obama, it seems we have a problem.""</p> <p>That's right, my credit card was denied.</p> <p>After 30 more minutes of haggling, I finally made it to the convention, only to learn that I was thought of so highly by the Democratic party that my credentials barely granted me access to the men's room - let alone backstage where all the action was. And so, being the VIP that I was, I spent the rest of the week as the guy in the room who nobody knew, but everyone knew didn't belong.</p> <p>Needless to say, when they asked me to be the convention's keynote speaker just four years later, I made sure I was getting a car. All joking aside, receiving that honour was a welcome change - and, as MasterCard could attest, more than a little unlikely.</p>",1557,false,2017-11-25T22:12:10Z,UK,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24t9v,false,true,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/1/20/1232444611885/ObamaDC2004trail.jpg,false,en,true,"First speech on Iraq as President Bush authorises going to war 2 October 2002 Federal Plaza, Chicago I don't oppose all wars.

On ending America's fossil fuel addiction 3 April 2006 Chicago When it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change is coming from the very people who are running the country. By now, the Bush administration's record on climate change is almost legendary. This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans. This is the administration that didn't try to improve the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to stem climate change. And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a Nasa scientist for letting the rest of us know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal ... This is not a serious effort. Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program. It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it. The challenge of going into politics, with 'that funny name' 11 May 2006 Emily's List annual lunch, Washington I remember when I first ran for the state senate - my very first race. A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running. Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife. And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen. I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature. And everywhere I went I'd get two questions: First, they'd ask, ""Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"" Because people just couldn't pronounce it. They'd call me ""Alabama,"" or they'd call me ""Yo Mama"". And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya. And the second thing people would ask me was, ""You seem like a nice young man. You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organise voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"" On the embarrassment of his first Democratic convention 2 June 2006 University of Massachusetts, Boston It's always great to be back in Boston. As some of you may have heard, I was here a few years ago to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention. It was an amazing experience for me. A humbling honour. A tremendous opportunity. And if you had come up to me a few years earlier and told me I'd be there, I would've politely told you that you were out of your mind. Let me tell you what happened at the last convention I had been to. It was the year 2000, and I had just gotten my rear-end handed to me in my very first race for Congress. Didn't even make it past the primary. I was a little depressed, and more than a little broke, but some friends suggested that I get my mind off it by going to Los Angeles, where that year's Democratic convention was being held. So I decided to go. And when my plane landed in LA, I got my luggage, walked on over to the Hertz counter, filled out all the forms to rent a car, gave my credit card to the nice woman behind the counter who, moments later, handed it back to me and said, ""Mr Obama, it seems we have a problem."" That's right, my credit card was denied. After 30 more minutes of haggling, I finally made it to the convention, only to learn that I was thought of so highly by the Democratic party that my credentials barely granted me access to the men's room - let alone backstage where all the action was. And so, being the VIP that I was, I spent the rest of the week as the guy in the room who nobody knew, but everyone knew didn't belong. Needless to say, when they asked me to be the convention's keynote speaker just four years later, I made sure I was getting a car. All joking aside, receiving that honour was a welcome change - and, as MasterCard could attest, more than a little unlikely.",8498,NA,6,false,2009-01-20,NA,NA

I commit America to work with all the world to end extreme poverty in our generation, convert to sustainable energy and ecosystem use, and stabilise the world's population by 2050, before our numbers and resource demands overwhelm the planet and our fragile capacity to co-operate.

We and our adversaries no longer target each other. More and more we need to join hands to tackle threats facing the whole world: financial disarray, climate change, diseases, nuclear proliferation, and terrorists or governments acting erratically. The US must remain militarily strong but will gain in security and save sorely needed resources by avoiding new arms races and reaching global agreements on arms control. </p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patriciawilliams"">Patricia Williams</a>: Let science inform faith</h2> <p>It is my profound hope that in the years to come, we may find ourselves united in love of our shared home, not only defence of the homeland; in reverence for the constitution, not merely obeisance to the nation-state; in collaborative debate as well as decisive action; and in peace, not only pacification. Let us also ensure that science informs our faith, and that our faith not be blind to the rich diversity of community and human need.</p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjaminbarber"">Benjamin Barber</a>: Creating opportunity in crisis</h2> <p>In the midst of crisis, we can prime the credit pump and push consumers back into the mall. Or we can turn the fiscal disaster into an opportunity to change habits and attitudes and create a new and green sustainable economy; encourage saving not spending; invest in education and culture; lower energy consumption and slow growth; give government help to homeowners and job-holders, rather than banks and corporations. We should put our pain to the purposes of birthing a new democratic civil society in which the economy serves us, not the other way round. </p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pankajmishra"">Pankaj Mishra</a>: Influence trumps force</h2> <p>In international affairs, I will always bear in mind the words of George Kennan, neglected prophet of cold war America, who believed our nation would exercise its greatest influence by manifesting civilised values rather than by trying to impose them on others through military force: any message we try to bring to others will be effective only if it is in accord with what we are to ourselves, and if this is something sufficiently impressive to compel the respect and confidence of a world which, despite all its material difficulties, is still more ready to recognise and respect spiritual distinction than material opulence.</p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jayatighosh"">Jayati Ghosh</a>: A commitment to peaceful multilateralism</h2> <p>I commit my administration to peaceful multilateralism. Politically, the US will not resort to military intervention until all other solutions have been explored. I will work for lasting and just peace in the Middle East, beginning with quick action to stop the carnage in Gaza. Economically, we will strongly back international moves to regulate finance, to make trade less unequal and to allow greater policy autonomy for developing countries. My government's fiscal stimulus package will be oriented to making production and consumption patterns within the US more sustainable and will address problems of excessive resource use and climate change.</p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpilger"">John Pilger</a>: Redress for criminal wars</h2> <p>My fellow human beings, I pledge on this historic day that the US will cease its multiple acts of aggression against humanity and withdraw immediately from Iraq, Afghanistan and 770 military bases around the world.

If there is a disparity between the values that we say we stand for and our actions internationally then we have become a dissonant society that does not practise what it preaches. We must stand for what we believe in: a society that cares about all people. There can be no reconciliation with and redemption for those we have inhumanely incarcerated, wrongfully imprisoned and tortured without truth-telling and justice.

Every last one of you who bought a house in the past 10 years knew that the whole thing was a scam, that the inflated value of your house was the result of the subprime con-job. Every single one of you who invested in the stockmarket knew the whole thing was a house of cards, that when stocks are trading at 40 times current earnings the market is rigged. Every last one of you tolerated George Bush when he made you rich, just as our British friends tolerated Maggie Thatcher and Tony Blair and only turned against them when things started to go south.

Without a solution to the Palestinian problem, no stable or promising future in this region will be possible, including long-term security for Israel. I hope my Jewish fellow Americans recognise that the major obstacle to such a solution is the unwillingness of Israel to accept a viable Palestinian state.

Violence against women, within their families and from the outside: this is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. If half the world's population remains vulnerable to economic, political, legal, and social marginalisation, our hope of advancing democracy and prosperity is in serious jeopardy.

They've become the province of extremists, enemies of peace. These very days, Israel urges the return of PLO rule to Gaza, and of international forces to its border. My administration, committed to Israel's security and to Palestinian independence, will use its best endeavours to impose a solution – the two-state solution that all sane people want – on the two nations.

I am as resolved to isolate and defeat our enemies as any American could be - no one should misunderstand that - we will do that best when we adhere to our highest principles; that's when the people of the world will see most clearly that our way - freedom of speech and worship, equality for women, the rule of law - is the best way, and the people of America will see those striving people across the world as brothers and sisters in the fight for liberty and dignity.</p> <h2><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/bonniegreer"">Bonnie Greer</a>: The lesson of Lassie</h2> <p>A joke the late, great Lenny Bruce used to tell is: ""What's the difference - in a movie - between Lassie and a black man?

That's the way it was, and there are many of you in this audience today who know the deep meaning of Bruce's joke, and who know what I mean.

But it's a mistake to believe that either one offers perfect protection. In the wake of Enron, Congress enacted new rules. Sarbanes Oxley did nothing to prevent the current crisis, because regulation tends to be a modern Maginot line. As for the oxymoron of corporate ethics, put faith in that at your peril. What might work? Change the incentives. Reward our business leaders when they build companies that are successful over the long term.

""It is a great chance to take a break from the bad news in Kenya.""</p> <p>It is also a chance to make money.

After buying a badge, Vitalis Omondi, 36, said: ""I never believed that Bush would agree to leave office and allow Obama in – that doesn't happen here.""</p> <p>A publishing company was selling a locally written biography of Obama for £2.50. Nearby a photographer had set up a stall selling framed photographic portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is also from the region.</p> <p>Students at the adjacent secondary school had arrived for class in their neat blue and white uniforms, but were soon released from their lessons.</p> <p>George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study, was among a group of boys rushing towards the primary school football field where Obama FC was about to take to the pitch.</p> <p>""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said. ""If you believe something then you can do it.""</p> <p>Otieno's dream is to become a lawyer, and he is hoping the Obama presidency will help him get a scholarship to a US university. The expectation that Kogelo, and Kenya more broadly, will receive a boost from Washington in the form of grants and favours over the next four years is not an uncommon sentiment among ordinary people.</p> <p>Writing in the Nation newspaper today, the columnist Macharia Gaitho said that while Kenyans were celebrating louder than the American ""owners of the party"", these types of expectations needed to be lowered.</p> <p>""True, he [Obama] does have an attachment to the country,"" he wrote, ""but it would be foolish of us to wait for him to direct Air Force 1 [sic] and the entire American fleet to bring goodies to our starving shores.""</p>",768,false,2017-07-15T02:09:54Z,UK,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24thn,false,true,http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/1/20/1232445485844/A-vendor-walks-past-souve-003.jpg,false,en,true,"He may be the about to become the 44th president of the US, but today Kenyans have been celebrating Barack Obama's inauguration as if he were their own leader.

""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old maths teacher at the Barack Obama primary school. ""He is our son."" And not just a village son, or even a son of the Luo ethnic group, but a child of the entire country, judging by the parties taking place across Kenya. Along the coast, hotels have organised night-long ""Yes We Did"" bashes, while in the capital, Nairobi, where special Obama prayer services are scheduled for this afternoon, bars are anticipating one of the busiest nights of the year. In western towns such as Kakamega and Kisumu, tens of thousands of people are expected to watch the inauguration on giant screens – and forget about the grand corruption scandals and looming famine in their own country. ""Everybody is dwelling on the Obama victory,"" said Jael Lieta, a 24-year-old radio presenter in Kisumu. ""It is a great chance to take a break from the bad news in Kenya."" It is also a chance to make money. The country's biggest brewer, which already has a brand of beer called Senator, has launched a special edition President lager. A mobile phone company is selling one-off Yes We Can handsets. In Nairobi, a hospitality institute has been advertising for new students by declaring: ""Obamamania is set to grow Kenya's tourism industry – this is change you can believe in"". It is true that Kogelo, home to about 5,000 people, has already become a sightseeing attraction for foreigner visitors. Signs for ""tourist hotels"" have sprung up along the main road since November's election result. With a planned museum yet to be built, the only real sight is the home of Obama's grandmother Mama Sarah, who, along with several other close relatives, has travelled to the inauguration in Washington. A group of camera-toting South Korean students seemed devastated to hear this, only for the police guarding the house to enter into the party spirit by allowing them a brief look around the property. A short walk up the road at the primary school, vendors hawked commemorative T-shirts, caps, calendars, traditional print wraps and lapel badges with slogans such as ""Obama the 44th"". After buying a badge, Vitalis Omondi, 36, said: ""I never believed that Bush would agree to leave office and allow Obama in – that doesn't happen here."" A publishing company was selling a locally written biography of Obama for £2.50. Nearby a photographer had set up a stall selling framed photographic portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is also from the region. Students at the adjacent secondary school had arrived for class in their neat blue and white uniforms, but were soon released from their lessons. George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study, was among a group of boys rushing towards the primary school football field where Obama FC was about to take to the pitch. ""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said. ""If you believe something then you can do it."" Otieno's dream is to become a lawyer, and he is hoping the Obama presidency will help him get a scholarship to a US university. The expectation that Kogelo, and Kenya more broadly, will receive a boost from Washington in the form of grants and favours over the next four years is not an uncommon sentiment among ordinary people. Writing in the Nation newspaper today, the columnist Macharia Gaitho said that while Kenyans were celebrating louder than the American ""owners of the party"", these types of expectations needed to be lowered. ""True, he [Obama] does have an attachment to the country,"" he wrote, ""but it would be foolish of us to wait for him to direct Air Force 1 [sic] and the entire American fleet to bring goodies to our starving shores.""",4504,Xan Rice in Kogelo,NA,false,2009-01-21,"<span data-tag-id=""19528"" class=""contributor"">Xan Rice</span> in Kogelo",NA

Our time to write a new chapter in the American story. Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.</p> <p>And then some day, some day, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.</p> <p>They can say that this was the time when America found its way. They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</p> <h2>Recollections of his father, while visiting Kenya</h2> <p><strong>28 August 2006</strong><br><strong>University of Nairobi</strong></p> <p>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987. I had just finished three years of work as a community organiser in low-income neighbourhoods of Chicago, and was about to enrol in law school. My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.</p> <p>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip. Instead of a motorcade, we travelled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already 10 years old. When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road. I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi. When we went upcountry, we travelled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap.</p> <p>But it was a magical trip. To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty. I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.</p> <p>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.</p> <p>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called ""boy"" by his employers for most of his life. I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the ""Pipeline"" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.</p> <p>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult. I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had travelled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya. In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early 60s, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.</p> <p>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments. His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years. And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.</p> <h2>Statement to the Senate on homeland security</h2> <p><strong>27 September 2006</strong><br><strong>Washington</strong></p> <p>The vast majority of the folks in Guantánamo, I suspect, are there for a reason. There are a lot of dangerous people. Particularly dangerous are people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Ironically, those are the guys who are going to get real military procedures because they are going to be charged by the government. But detainees who have not committed war crimes - or where the government's case is not strong - may not have any recourse whatsoever.</p> <p>The bottom line is this: current procedures under the CSRT [combatant status review tribunals] are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the government's case and has no way of proving his innocence.</p> <p>I would like somebody in this chamber, somebody in this government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. I know that every time I think about my two little girls and worry for their safety - when I wonder if I really can tuck them in at night and know that they are safe from harm. I have as big of a stake as anybody on the other side of the aisle and anybody in this administration in capturing terrorists and incapacitating them. I would gladly take up arms myself against any terrorist threat to make sure my family is protected.</p> <p>But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantánamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence.</p> <p>This is not just an entirely fictional scenario, by the way. We have already had reports by the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantánamo should not have been there. As one US commander of Guantánamo told the Wall Street Journal: ""Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks.""</p> <h2>Global summit on Aids and the church</h2> <p><strong>1 December 2006</strong><br><strong>Saddleback church campus, California</strong></p> <p>I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren.</p> <p>Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by Aids, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do. Their decision to devote their time, their money and their purpose-driven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and Aids. The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease.</p> <h2>Statement to the Senate on the Iraq war de-escalation act</h2> <p><strong>30 January 2007</strong><br><strong>Washington</strong></p> <p>Mr President, today in Iraq we sadly find ourselves at the very point I feared most when I opposed giving the president the open-ended authority to wage this war in 2002 - an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the midst of a country torn by civil war.</p> <p>The American people have waited and the American people have been patient. We have given chance after chance for a resolution that has not come, and, more importantly, watched with horror and grief the tragic loss of thousands of brave young American soldiers.</p> <p>The time for waiting in Iraq is over. The days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close. And the need to bring this war to an end is here.</p> <h2>Announcement of entry to Democratic presidential race</h2> <p><strong>10 February 2007</strong><br><strong>Springfield, Illinois</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gdJ7Ad15WCA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed""                                                                        > <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/gdJ7Ad15WCA&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""https://www.youtube.com/v/gdJ7Ad15WCA&hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Let me tell you how I came to be here.

I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections. But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organiser for $13,000 a year. And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.</p> <p>My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighbourhoods. I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closures. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.</p> <p>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.</p> <p>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need. I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate. </p> <p>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state senator.</p> <p>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and labourers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamouring to be heard.

This time can be different.</p> <p>And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states north and south, east and west, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change.

In South Carolina, where the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans.</p> <p>This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough"". We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarisation, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well.</p> <p>And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn.</p> <p>On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike.</p> <p>I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed.</p> <p>But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam.</p> <p>As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all ...</p> <p>For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings.</p> <p>And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.</p> <p>In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labour. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighbourhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.</p> <p>Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talkshow hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.</p> <p>Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle-class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favour the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognising they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.</p> <h2>Final primary night: presumptive Democratic nominee speech</h2> <p><strong>3 June 2008</strong><br><strong>St Paul, Minnesota</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gI3FLN1t8j0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed""                                                                        > <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/gI3FLN1t8j0&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""https://www.youtube.com/v/gI3FLN1t8j0&hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Tonight, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end.</p> <p>Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been travelled. Millions of voices have been heard. And because of what you said - because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another - a journey that will bring a new and better day to America. Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.</p> <p>At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office. I have not just competed with them as rivals, I have learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party, and leaders that America will turn to for years to come.</p> <p>That is particularly true for the candidate who has travelled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight.</p> <p>We've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But our party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honour to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p> <h2>Acceptance speech at the Democratic convention</h2> <p><strong>28 August 2008</strong><br><strong>Mile High stadium, Denver</strong></p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZCrIeRkMhA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed""                                                                        > <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/yZCrIeRkMhA&hl=en&fs=1""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""https://www.youtube.com/v/yZCrIeRkMhA&hl=en&fs=1"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""425"" height=""344""></embed></object> </figure>   <p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough ...""</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <h2>Election night victory speech</h2> <p><strong>4 November 2008</strong><br><strong>Grant Park, Chicago</strong></p>      <video data-media-id=""gu-video-339344772"" class=""gu-video"" controls=""controls"" poster=""""> <source src=""https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1900433074_gdn-nat-081105-ag-obama-speech-full-01-VFa-4x3.flv""/> </video>   <p>If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer ... </p> <p>I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.</p> <p>It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organised, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory ...</p> <p>The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there.</p> <p>There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.</p> <p>• Edited speeches reprinted courtesy of Obama for America, the official website of the Barack Obama election campaign (<a href=""http://www.barackobama.com"">barackobama.com</a>).

As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all ... For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labour. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighbourhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talkshow hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle-class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favour the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognising they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. Final primary night: presumptive Democratic nominee speech 3 June 2008 St Paul, Minnesota Tonight, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been travelled. Millions of voices have been heard. And because of what you said - because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another - a journey that will bring a new and better day to America. Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office. I have not just competed with them as rivals, I have learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party, and leaders that America will turn to for years to come. That is particularly true for the candidate who has travelled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. We've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But our party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honour to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Acceptance speech at the Democratic convention 28 August 2008 Mile High stadium, Denver We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush. America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough ..."" You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI bill. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States. Election night victory speech 4 November 2008 Grant Park, Chicago If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer ... I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organised, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory ... The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. • Edited speeches reprinted courtesy of Obama for America, the official website of the Barack Obama election campaign (barackobama.com).

She was knowingly tapping into an old, rich tradition of suspicion against fancy highfalutin speechifying and anything smelling of the intellectual that runs through American democratic populism.

He added, however: ""Personally, I like him.""</p> <p>Most Russians appear to agree – praising his ""powerful"" delivery but also noting he looked a bit nervous, especially at the beginning. They were generally optimistic that Obama would now bring positive changes, though.</p> <p>""I expect him to practise a greener kind of politics,"" Konstantin Zgurovsky, a 56-year-old ecologist, said. ""I think he will pay greater attention to domestic problems and pull the US army out of Iraq.""</p> <p>Others were more equivocal. ""Unquestionably there will be changes. But what they are we still don't know yet. I hope he quickly resolves the US's crisis, so that Russia's economic problems become easier,"" Tatyana Bazlova, 27, from Pskov said.</p> <p>There was also general agreement that the 44th president could only be an improvement on the disastrous 43rd; George Bush is seen in Russia, as elsewhere, as a warmonger.

I hope Obama prefers to use his intelligence rather than war as a means of influence,"" Alena Pravidla, 31, from Moscow said.</p> <h2>Martin Chulov in Baghdad</h2> <p>Many Iraqis seemed nonplussed at the swearing-in of Obama, with some not knowing the inauguration was taking place and others consumed by the fall-out from the outgoing presidency.</p> <p>Obama's messages of change and remaking America have yet to resonate in the country that will help shape the legacy of his first years in office. Some Baghdadis, however, were impressed by his inauguration speech.</p> <p>""If he can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over,"" said Abu Ali, the owner of a sparkling new restaurant, Shisha Cafe, in the city's Karada district. ""I believe he is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests,"" he added. ""That's it.""</p> <p>Another cafe-goer, Haitham Sarkis, said that his family had long ago stopped listening to Bush and become dispirited by his last three years in office.</p> <p>""He kept telling us one thing, yet we were living the other,"" he said. ""This man never knew us and we are left with a massive mess that we must now pick up, not the new president.""</p> <p>The US presence on the streets of Baghdad may be slowly diminishing, but the withdrawal of the occupying forces is not generating a rise in America's popularity.</p> <p>Iraqi children and youths regularly taunt each other by removing their shoes and threatening to throw them – mimicking the local journalist who humiliated Bush during his last visit in December.</p> <p>""Obama won't get the same treatment,"" said a nurse from the northern suburb of Adamiyeh, Um Nassir. ""But he won't have too long to prove himself to us.""</p> <p>Bush, however, is not a villain to all. ""He always said history will judge him,"" said Samira Musawi, a parliamentarian. ""But God will judge him as well and God has used Bush to remove the evil of Saddam and set the Iraqi nation free. It is now our responsibility to find the right way to direct this change.""</p> <h2>Rory Carroll in Caracas</h2> <p>Obama spoke of a world remade but Luis Fernando's Caracas slum did not look any different and he saw little reason to think US policy towards Hugo Chávez and Latin America would be any different.</p> <p>The 50-year-old security guard watched the inauguration speech dubbed into Spanish on a flickery TV and shrugged. ""Seems to me he is going to be just like the other one, Bush. He hasn't even started yet and he's already making threats against us.""</p> <p>Fernando, from El Valle, a hillside of precarious shacks in Venezuela's capital, supports Chávez's socialist revolution and is suspicious of the superpower. ""It's good that a man of colour is in the White House; he may show solidarity with Latin America."" </p> <p>But the self-proclaimed ""Chavista"" echoed his beloved president in suspecting that as surely as a tropical sun shone overhead Washington would stir trouble. </p> <p>Chávez reaped acclaim for standing up to Bush, who backed a failed coup against him in 2002 before going on to invade Iraq.

The rhetoric galvanised his red-clad supporters and tarred opponents as CIA stooges.</p> <p>The ascent of a black US president who opposed the Iraq war has presented Chávez, who revels in confrontation, with a dilemma.

""Let's give Obama a chance. Give him some time and see what he does.""</p> <h2>Rory McCarthy in Gaza City</h2> <p>In the Popeye Cafe in Gaza City, dozens of young Palestinians sat in front of the television drinking tea and smoking water-pipes tonight, but, though they glanced up at Obama's speech occasionally, very few believe the new US president will make any difference to their lives.</p> <p>""I have a feeling deep inside me that we shouldn't expect anything from Obama,"" said Taher Yazji, 24, whose family runs a printing business. ""All of them speak of the Middle East as a priority but we don't see anything from them, no results at all. I don't think the ordinary people of America understand what has happened to us.

Troops out of Iraq means much to the estimated <a href=""http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/asylum/lifeline/pages.asp?country=iq&amp;id=8&amp;misc1=facts_country"">500,000 Iraqis currently living in refugee camps in Jordan</a>, many with little access to housing and education.

""Hope"" is probably the last idea that would accompany it. The aerial bombardment and later ground invasion of the Gaza Strip over the last three weeks has changed everything, and few people here watched the build-up to the inauguration. While CNN is spending 48 hours in ceaseless coverage of events in Washington, reporting the great narrative of American political change, the focus of Arab news networks and of people in the Middle East is still largely on Gaza – the <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7839075.stm"">dead and the tens of thousands now homeless</a>.</p> <p>Every Middle Easterner knows who Livni is now, and Obama is now often currently seen as the good man who did nothing – who, his difficult position during the transition period acknowledged, nonetheless frustrated many by barely speaking out while some 1,300 Gazans were killed by one of America's closest allies. Around <a href=""http://middleeastdesk.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=15"">half of Jordan's population is of recent Palestinian descent</a>, and Gaza is less than 100 miles from Amman. But the geographic proximity felt increasingly like a bad joke or a mind trick, as the already-blockaded Strip became increasingly sealed under siege, and Jordanian-Palestinians were left unable to contact their families and friends on the other side of Israel.</p> <p>Obama encouraged Americans to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/19/obama-honours-martin-luther-king"">spend this year's Martin Luther King day volunteering</a> for their communities. Over the past three weeks here, Jordanians, Palestinians and others bought food and medical supplies and organised dozens of fundraisers for international charities working in Gaza. The Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation was overwhelmed by <a href=""http://english.pnn.ps/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4510&amp;Itemid=50"">donations from ordinary people of canned food and medical supplies for UNRWA aid convoys</a>, an initiative which suffered a setback on January 8 when UNRWA seemed about to leave Gaza when the <a href=""http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/01/2009181482839688.html"">its aid convoy was hit</a>.</p> <p>Al Jazeera, the only television news network with a presence in Gaza during the military offensive, provided a constant (and eventually, perhaps, unhelpful) <a href=""http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/war_on_gaza/2009/01/20091585448204690.html"">stream</a> of graphic images of the dead and wounded civilians in Gaza. American networks seemed content to represent the feeling of the region solely through reporting Muslim Brotherhood-backed protests in the Middle East, replete with iconic stereotypes of flag-burning and violent threats – and there's no denying that the Gaza attack brought every odious, antisemitic Islamist spokesperson out of the woodwork. But many more ordinary Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese participated in far-less-newsworthy efforts such as <a href=""http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=13158"">blood drives</a> to help the injured in Gaza.</p> <p>With the tentative ceasefire now in place, Gaza, like many other tragedies, will go back to its low-level, un-newsworthy state of humanitarian crisis, and there will be little hope, or change, in this part of the world in the coming weeks. This is not to say Obama has become an unpopular figure here. If asked about him, most people still mention his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxqGH-lK5tk"">speech facing the ruins of the Umayyad Palace in Amman</a> last summer, and the fact that he has signalled a willingness, at least, to talk to all heads-of-state in order to repair international ties damaged by the Bush administration. But for the last three weeks here, you'd have to mention his name for people to talk about him. The great story of America's chance for change in Obama isn't the narrative that dominates the days here.</p> <p>Obama's inauguration is historic and contains, at least, the hope for change. Unlike most American stories pushing humanitarian tragedies off the front page, Obama deserves to dominate the world's news today. From here, the start of Obama's presidency is the start of one dream fulfilled. But the dream of a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians is still denied. It still festers.</p> <p>A hundred miles away from Gaza, it feels as though so much has happened since the optimism of November's election night that, while most here still wish Obama well, there is little to hope for or celebrate. In his inauguration speech, Obama claimed to ""seek a new way forward"" with the Muslim world, and that ""those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy"". Obama still represents a better chance than his predecessors for something lasting and just to be built in the Middle East, but it is far from being fulfilled.</p>",895,false,2017-07-15T02:09:44Z,UK,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24jxk,false,true,NA,false,en,true,"Watching Barack Obama's inauguration on television in Amman, Jordan, as he stumbled over his words during the oath, then spoke eloquently of Americans now choosing ""our better history"", I wanted to celebrate, like many, as we did in November.

The Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation was overwhelmed by donations from ordinary people of canned food and medical supplies for UNRWA aid convoys, an initiative which suffered a setback on January 8 when UNRWA seemed about to leave Gaza when the its aid convoy was hit. Al Jazeera, the only television news network with a presence in Gaza during the military offensive, provided a constant (and eventually, perhaps, unhelpful) stream of graphic images of the dead and wounded civilians in Gaza. American networks seemed content to represent the feeling of the region solely through reporting Muslim Brotherhood-backed protests in the Middle East, replete with iconic stereotypes of flag-burning and violent threats – and there's no denying that the Gaza attack brought every odious, antisemitic Islamist spokesperson out of the woodwork. But many more ordinary Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese participated in far-less-newsworthy efforts such as blood drives to help the injured in Gaza. With the tentative ceasefire now in place, Gaza, like many other tragedies, will go back to its low-level, un-newsworthy state of humanitarian crisis, and there will be little hope, or change, in this part of the world in the coming weeks. This is not to say Obama has become an unpopular figure here. If asked about him, most people still mention his speech facing the ruins of the Umayyad Palace in Amman last summer, and the fact that he has signalled a willingness, at least, to talk to all heads-of-state in order to repair international ties damaged by the Bush administration. But for the last three weeks here, you'd have to mention his name for people to talk about him. The great story of America's chance for change in Obama isn't the narrative that dominates the days here. Obama's inauguration is historic and contains, at least, the hope for change. Unlike most American stories pushing humanitarian tragedies off the front page, Obama deserves to dominate the world's news today. From here, the start of Obama's presidency is the start of one dream fulfilled. But the dream of a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians is still denied. It still festers. A hundred miles away from Gaza, it feels as though so much has happened since the optimism of November's election night that, while most here still wish Obama well, there is little to hope for or celebrate. In his inauguration speech, Obama claimed to ""seek a new way forward"" with the Muslim world, and that ""those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy"". Obama still represents a better chance than his predecessors for something lasting and just to be built in the Middle East, but it is far from being fulfilled.",5503,Heather McRobie,NA,true,2009-01-20,"<span data-tag-id=""24899"" class=""contributor"">Heather McRobie</span>",2009-01-23T20:35:42Z

He <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/12/tonyblair-labour"">exempted formula one motor racing from the ban on tobacco sponsorship</a> after a donation from Bernie Ecclestone. He carried on his uncritical courtship of the city and private sector – signing <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4354917,00.html"">letters for Mittal steel</a>, promoting 24-hour drinking, super-casinos and other illiberal causes. He encouraged deregulation, PFI bonanzas that made the Thatcher years look austere. Not to mention the Iraq war. He dismissed the protest of millions before the day was over – ""so Iraqis would have the right to protest too"". </p> <p>Of course, Kennedy, Wilson and Blair did many good things. But the expectation they would live up to their own rhetoric belied the reality of political life, human weakness, vanity and the desire to be liked – as later revealed by their advisers. It is sad and unfair that they may be remembered more for our disappointment in them rather than their achievements.</p> <p>And that's the rub. We want politicians like Obama, Blair, Wilson and Kennedy to be our better selves – indeed better than our better selves. Reading Obama's wonderful autobiography, Dreams of My Father, I could not help but succumb to the hope that this man so painfully self-aware and self-critical might be different. He might just remember his time on the streets of Chicago and the needs of the poor people he tried to help. For him, grassroots are familiar territory, not just a phrase written for him by a smart speechwriter.</p> <p>But there I go, hoping again that Obama will be different. It's that old problem – pessimism of the head and optimism of the heart.

When Blair won, my company took the day off to celebrate. I even became British to vote against the Tories. But his political self emerged in his first year. He exempted formula one motor racing from the ban on tobacco sponsorship after a donation from Bernie Ecclestone. He carried on his uncritical courtship of the city and private sector – signing letters for Mittal steel, promoting 24-hour drinking, super-casinos and other illiberal causes. He encouraged deregulation, PFI bonanzas that made the Thatcher years look austere. Not to mention the Iraq war. He dismissed the protest of millions before the day was over – ""so Iraqis would have the right to protest too"". Of course, Kennedy, Wilson and Blair did many good things. But the expectation they would live up to their own rhetoric belied the reality of political life, human weakness, vanity and the desire to be liked – as later revealed by their advisers. It is sad and unfair that they may be remembered more for our disappointment in them rather than their achievements. And that's the rub. We want politicians like Obama, Blair, Wilson and Kennedy to be our better selves – indeed better than our better selves. Reading Obama's wonderful autobiography, Dreams of My Father, I could not help but succumb to the hope that this man so painfully self-aware and self-critical might be different. He might just remember his time on the streets of Chicago and the needs of the poor people he tried to help. For him, grassroots are familiar territory, not just a phrase written for him by a smart speechwriter. But there I go, hoping again that Obama will be different. It's that old problem – pessimism of the head and optimism of the heart. But even after all the disillusionment with politics, it keeps me going.",3726,Roger Graef,NA,true,2009-01-20,"<span data-tag-id=""22406"" class=""contributor"">Roger Graef</span>",2009-01-23T12:00:01Z

""He remains hard to read or label - centrist in his appointments and bipartisan in his style, yet also pushing the broadest expansion of government in generations ... He will eventually have to choose between competing advice and priorities, risking the disappointment or anger of constituencies that for the moment can still see in him what they hope to see."" Obama will inherit a catastrophic economic situation, a war he did not support, and a host of other problems - not least the towering public expectations for his administration. His aides have been promising that he will hit the ground running. For a few more hours, though, that's all in the future.

Photograph: Simon Akam</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Simon Akam</span> </figcaption> </figure>","<p>The trees on the upper flanks of Mount Mansfield were choked with snow. Spruce and hemlock, their branches sagged beneath a thick mantle that had tumbled out of a Vermont storm two days before. We advanced gingerly along the narrow path between the trunks, knocking showers of crystals off the foliage, and our skis creaked on the deep drifts underfoot. Then the slope began to steepen, and we knew that we had reached the start of the Teardrop Trail, one of the classic backcountry ski descents in the eastern United States.</p> <p>The Teardrop, along with its Mount Mansfield neighbour the Bruce Trail, and a host of other wild forest ski runs across New England, is a direct legacy of the Great Depression. In 1933, with one in four Americans out of work, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps as part of his New Deal to reinvigorate the US economy. The aim of the CCC was to address national environmental needs while at the same time providing jobs, and in its nine-year life some 2.5 million men would pass through ""Roosevelt's Forest Army"".</p> <p>In the western and southern US the organisation built roads, parks and irrigation systems, and provided disaster assistance. However, in New England, under the supervision of Vermont State Forester Perry Merrill, the corps set to work on a different project. Merrill was a fanatical skier, and used his ""CCC boys"" to cut several ski trails through the forests of Mount Mansfield above the Vermont town of Stowe. Other contingents chopped routes on Mount Washington in New Hampshire and Mount Greylock in Massachusetts. </p> <p>Seven decades on, with the world engulfed by another deep economic recession, and with the speculation that the incoming Obama administration will try to implement a second New Deal, I wanted to trace the evergreen legacy of the first, in the coniferous woods of New England. </p> <p>I travelled to Stowe, now a chic resort with a surfeit of clapboard churches, on the Amtrak Vermonter. The descendant of the original ""snow trains"" that first opened the New England mountains to tourists in the 1930s, the Vermonter pulls out of Penn Station in New York before winding its leisurely way into Connecticut and Massachusetts. There are certainly quicker ways to travel - the train from New York to Waterbury, the nearest station to Stowe, takes around nine hours, substantially longer than the drive - but few are more picturesque. As we ambled north, I watched the snow, a mere smattering in Manhattan, deepen steadily in the trackside woods. At Amherst, a college town in Massachusetts, icicles hung bayonet-length from the eaves of the station, and by the time we rolled into Vermont a fine spindrift had blown into the gangways between the carriages, riming the fixtures and doors. </p> <p>After arriving at Waterbury, where ice-cream fans can take a tour of the Ben &amp; Jerry's factory, I caught a lift for the few miles to Stowe. There I lodged in the Riverside Inn, a converted 19th-century farmhouse run by Julian and Kay Bartlett, a British couple who emigrated to Vermont from Hertfordshire 12 years ago. </p> <p>I had arranged to ski the Teardrop and Bruce trails with Mark Puleio, a Vermont based mountain guide. Today it is possible to access the Bruce, though not the Teardrop, from the Stowe ski lift system. However, in order to experience the trails in the original spirit, Mark and I had decided to eschew lifts altogether, and to use legwork as 1930s skiers would have done. In order to make the ascents, we were equipped with touring skis with an adjustable binding that can unclip at the heel, and ""skins"" - nylon and mohair strips that attach to the base of the ski. Skins are smooth one way and rough the other, and allow the skier to move uphill without sliding back down.</p> <p>Given the amount of climbing we had ahead of us an early start was required. It was well before dawn when we arrived at the bottom of the 1,340m (4,395ft) Mt Mansfield, but there was enough light from the dying moon that we barely needed our head-torches. </p> <p>After a stiff hour-long 610m (2,000ft) climb, the wooded flanks of the valley had retreated below us and the sky was streaked violet behind the nearby Worcester range. Turning northwest, we then took a summer toll road, closed and covered in snow, that traverses the flanks of Mt Mansfield. From the valley below, the peak - the highest in Vermont - resembles a man's head in profile, and its summits are named after facial features. Beneath the ""forehead"", where a broadcasting tower wore a magnificent suit of ice armour, we crossed over to the other side of the mountain and reached the head of the Teardrop trail. </p> <p>Stripping the skins from our skis, we clipped down our heels, and began the descent of the 70-year-old route. The conditions were excellent, with some banks of powder still intact, and the experience was totally removed from a typical resort run. The Teardrop twisted and chicaned down the hillside, always wide enough to ski, but in some places narrow enough for the branches to knit together overhead. Best of all, as the views opened up on to the rolling woodlands below, we had the run almost entirely to ourselves. </p> <p>We skied 610 vertical metres (2,000ft) down until the forest thinned out from thick spruce to elegant pale birch. The snow cover waned too as we scrubbed off altitude, exposing rocks and branches, so we re-fitted our climbing skins at the very end of the trail and began to head back up. Another climb was needed in order to reach our second objective, the Bruce trail.</p> <p>As we ascended the temperature plummeted and a savage wind begun to blow, so once we regained the toll road we wasted no time in hurrying back around the mountain to the head of the Bruce. There two local skiers joined us, making elegant telemark turns on their free-heel equipment. The second trail was a shorter descent than the Teardrop, but equally steep, dropping in a series of thrilling pitches through the woods before levelling out on the Nordic cross-country ski runs in the valley below. </p> <p>In falling snow and fading light, we eventually left the forest and reached the warmth of the Matterhorn Bar and Grill (""the bar that invented aprés ski in America"") in Stowe. After nine hours and 1,300m (4,300ft) of ascent a pint of River Trout beer was restorative. As I sipped the local dark brew, pumped from its keg with a hand-carved fish shaped tap, I decided that regardless of Obama's economic wizardry, in skiing terms Roosevelt's New Deal will be a hard act to follow. </p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p>Amtrak offers return tickets to Stowe from New York City on the Vermonter train for $98 (£70); <a href=""http://www.amtrak.com"">amtrak.com</a>, +1 800 872 7245.</p> <p>The Riverside Inn in Stowe has rooms in high season from $79; <a href=""http://www.rivinn.com"">rivinn.com</a>, +1 802 253 4217.</p> <p>Mark Puleio is available for ski touring and alpine, rock and ice climbing.

Obama is expected to favour red (even money), the choice of a radical, which we're used to seeing round the necks of left-leaning politicians. On the other hand, blue (11-8) might be more reassuring and inclusive. Clinton wore a blue tie to his first inauguration, red to the second.</p> <p>You can have 5-1 any other colour, which must be the best value of the day.

Itsabanker, whose ambition this morning was to catch up, has shot into a clear lead. </p> <p><strong>2.54pm The field at Sedgefield . . .</strong></p> <p>. . . is being led along just now by a horse called Leo Tolstoy. I suppose he'd be an appropriate winner for a three-mile slog round this track, ie a race that goes on forever. In case you missed it, it was revealed in yesterday's Guardian that the original title for 'War And Peace' was, improbably, 'All's Well That Ends Well'.</p> <p><strong>3pm Boys lands gamble</strong></p> <p>The Sedgefield race ended well for those that joined in the plunge on the Tim Walford-trained Minella Boys, sent off at 5-1 after being backed down from double-figures this morning. He won by half the length of the straight, with Ron Cox's tip, Matmata De Tendron, sticking on for a place at 10-1.</p> <p>Alone among our tipsters, <strong>Moremoneythantalent</strong> had that winner and moves into a clear second.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm Stamina to the fore at Sedgefield</strong></p> <p>Hi mike65ie, yes, today's races up north are turning into real slogs. I thought Glengap looked a possible for the future in the three-mile maiden chase just now. The form book will show he has now been pulled up both times over fences but this one, Howard Johnson's second-string in the race, wasn't put under terrible pressure when the pace started to lift. He might be handicapped to win over fences one day.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm Gold wraps it up</strong></p> <p>Jamie Spencer sent Shifting Gold (100-30) clear on the turn for home at Southwell and nothing was going to catch them from that point.

You can have 5-1 any other colour, which must be the best value of the day. It would be like Obama to make a small break with past tradition and take a non-partisan option (yellow?). Jonathan Freedland has promised to pass on the result as soon as he has it. 12.55pm Hi JDK1 No need to take offence! Where I come from, however muggy the reasoning behind a bet, it becomes instantly shrewd if you collect. 2.28pm That'll do for Itsabanker It looked like a winner for all of you who lined up behind 100-30 favourite It's Bertie in the handicap chase at Sedgefield, but he was overhauled close home by 20-1 outsider That'lldoforme. Itsabanker, whose ambition this morning was to catch up, has shot into a clear lead. 2.54pm The field at Sedgefield . . . . . . is being led along just now by a horse called Leo Tolstoy. I suppose he'd be an appropriate winner for a three-mile slog round this track, ie a race that goes on forever. In case you missed it, it was revealed in yesterday's Guardian that the original title for 'War And Peace' was, improbably, 'All's Well That Ends Well'. 3pm Boys lands gamble The Sedgefield race ended well for those that joined in the plunge on the Tim Walford-trained Minella Boys, sent off at 5-1 after being backed down from double-figures this morning. He won by half the length of the straight, with Ron Cox's tip, Matmata De Tendron, sticking on for a place at 10-1. Alone among our tipsters, Moremoneythantalent had that winner and moves into a clear second. 3.30pm Stamina to the fore at Sedgefield Hi mike65ie, yes, today's races up north are turning into real slogs. I thought Glengap looked a possible for the future in the three-mile maiden chase just now. The form book will show he has now been pulled up both times over fences but this one, Howard Johnson's second-string in the race, wasn't put under terrible pressure when the pace started to lift. He might be handicapped to win over fences one day. 4.10pm Gold wraps it up Jamie Spencer sent Shifting Gold (100-30) clear on the turn for home at Southwell and nothing was going to catch them from that point. That's a popular victory, as 10 of our tipsters are a few points better off now, including yesterday's joint-leader StarvnMarvn. Three more races and updated standings here tomorrow from about 11.30am, when the racing includes strong, competitive cards at Huntingdon and Musselburgh. 4.45pm Well done, favourite-backers!

But the banks were again the dominant feature of the day, with Lloyds Banking Group losing 20.2p to 44.8p on worries it could end up being nationalised by the UK government. Barclays fell 15.1p to 72.9p, while Royal Bank of Scotland, hit hard yesterday, saw an early bounce peter out and closed down 1.3p to 10.3p. A couple of new short disclosures were issued, with Landsdowne Global edging its bearish position in Barclays up from 0.25% to 0.26% and Paulson declared a 0.79% short in Lloyds. Talk that ratings agencies were nervous about UK debt levels given the amount the government is already pouring into the banks did not help overall sentiment, nor did another slump in the pound. Wall Street, closed yesterday for Martin Luther King day, celebrated Obama's big day by falling sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 140 points by the time London closed, while the FTSE 100 finished down 17.07 points at 4091.4. So with the banks under the cosh, many investors turned their attention to more defensive sectors. British American Tobacco closed 39p higher at £18.44 while pharmaceutical stocks were also in demand for their safe haven qualities, their status as dollar earners when the pound is crumbling, and hopes that Barack Obama will boost spending on US healthcare now his inauguration has finally taken place. AstraZeneca added 45p to £28.05, helped by a positive note from Citigroup, while GlaxoSmithKline rose 16.5p to £12.94 and Shire climbed 14p to £10.20. Medical group Smith &amp; Nephew, recommended by Exane BNP Paribas yesterday, closed 10.75p higher at 498p. There were some positive movements among the mid-caps after trading updates, with pubs group JD Wetherspoon 40.75p better at 315p, spread betting group IG 31.75p higher at 254p and luxury goods group Burberry up 25.5p to 231.25p. But downgrades from Credit Suisse hit property companies Brixton, down 14.5p at 105p, and Segro, 21.25p lower at 168.75p. Chip maker Wolfson Microelectronics lost 5p to 72p after being fined £140,000 by the City regulator for not releasing price sensitive information about a contract in time. Dan Ridsdale at Teathers said: ""The fine on Wolfson may force chip companies to disclose material design losses and wins sooner. Even if the customer is undisclosed, such a move is unlikely to be popular with original equipment manufacturers who demand confidentiality verging on secrecy."" Meanwhile he repeated his positive stance on CSR - down 8.75p at 157.25p - predicated on news shortly that it may have won a significant deal from Nokia.",3199,Nick Fletcher,NA,true,2009-01-20,"<span data-tag-id=""16178"" class=""contributor"">Nick Fletcher</span>",2009-01-27T16:16:00Z

But surely there's nobody with a warm heart beating in their chest, outside of Nottingham and Leicester, who wouldn't like to hear such a fairytale told. Is there? I mean, even trophy-laden Manchester United fans can't desire another League Cup bauble <em>that much</em>, can they?</p> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> is at 8pm; we'll get this report up and running when the teams come in just after 7pm. United's second string are almost bound to prevail, but remember: Derby hold a 1-0 aggregate lead after Kris Commons' Pride Park howitzer in the first leg, so a shock isn't <em>totally</em> beyond the realms of possibility.</p> <p><strong>And speaking of Derby's glory days,</strong> why not read Rob 'Bob' Smyth's excellent piece on <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jan/20/derby-county-title-win-rob-smyth"">the story of Derby's 1974/75 title success under Dave Mackay</a>?</p><!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>A Manchester United representative XI, with £8m Zoran Tosic on the bench:</strong> Foster, Rafael Da Silva, Neville, Evans, O'Shea, Nani, Gibson, Anderson, Giggs, Welbeck, Tevez.<br>Subs: Kuszczak, Ronaldo, Tosic, Scholes, Fletcher, Possebon, Chester.</p> <p><strong>Derby County welcome Paul Connolly and Jordan Stewart back from suspension:</strong> Carroll, Connolly, Albrechtsen, Todd, Stewart, Teale, Addison, Green, Davies, Commons, Hulse. Subs: Bywater, Savage, Villa, Barnes, Nyatanga, Barazite, Hines.</p> <p><strong>Ladies and gentlemen, the whistler from the Wirral...</strong> Mike Dean.</p><!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>And, without further ado, we're off!</strong> Derby kick off, and lose the ball within the first second. Dear me. Thankfully for all interested in some competition this evening, United immediately shank it straight out of play themselves.</p><!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Rafael zips past Stewart down the right, but after creating space can only wallop his cross into the side netting.</p><!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> A nice open flowing game here. Derby, through Commons and Hulse, enjoy a brief sortie down the right, then United stream forward straight down the middle, Giggs and Welbeck nearly combining to release Nani into the area. Todd steps in to clear. Meanwhile here's a nod to topicality from ""lapsed Derby fan"" Tom Hopkins. ""I've got to say that (based on very little evidence) I'm totally buying into the Clough Mark II thing. He's the white Obama!"" It's like TW3 never went off the air round here.</p><!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> You know that goal Commons scored in the first leg? Well that would have looked like a tap-in had this gone in. Gibson gives the ball away with a lazy crossfield pass, allowing Derby to break forward quickly. Hulse's forward pass looks like being cut out by Evans on the halfway line, but Commons robs him and charges down the inside-left channel. He's only got one thing on his mind, and when <em>at least</em> 35 yards out, hits a swerving, dipping shot which flies wide of the left-hand post. But only just. A very decent effort indeed.</p><!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Another decent forward thrust by Derby, as Neville is robbed by Stewart down the left. Stewart tears off into the United half. Neville comes back him, but is diddled by a little stop-start trick. Stewart is in acres, but his deep cross is aimed nowhere in particular and Evans clears calmly. This is a nice confident start by the visitors, who may well have decided there is bugger all to lose, so they may as well have a go.</p><!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> United aren't really clicking up front. Tevez and Giggs are trying their best to prompt, and Welbeck has enjoyed a couple of determined runs towards the box, but everything's being dealt with by Todd and Albrechtsen in the centre.</p><!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>16 min: GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Derby County (agg 1-1).</strong> This is pretty spectacular from United's persepective: Nani picks the ball up just inside the Derby half, cuts inside, drops a shoulder to skate past the challenge of Teale, and from a good 25 yards out to the left, arrows a screamer into the top-right corner. However from Derby's... well, who was making a challenge? And Carroll got a hand to the ball and - though the shot was travelling at pace - may think he should have done better.</p><!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Rafael is booked for a pretty crude lunge on Davies out on the Derby left. The free kick is kind of wasted, but the ball soon comes back at United, Neville being forced to cushion a clever header back to Foster when under severe pressure from Commons and Addison.</p><!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> United are passing it around. A lot.</p><!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>22 min: GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Derby County (agg 2-1).</strong> Terrible defending by Derby here. Tevez rolls a ball across the face of goal from the left. Welbeck immediately prods it forward into the box - where O'Shea should be caught offside, but Derby's back line is such a state that he's played miles on by the lumbering Teale, and has plenty of time to dig the pass out from under his feet and prod the ball past the advancing Carroll and into the net.</p><!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> United are passing it around again. A lot.</p><!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Derby can't keep hold of the ball. The pattern keeps repeating: Rafael shifts it inside to Anderson, who sprays it across to Nani, who slips it inside to Welbeck or Tevez. The ball's then hacked clear, and so the cycle begins again. ""Well, that's that then,"" writes Tom Hopkins. ""I hope President Obama keeps my optimism alive for longer.""</p><!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> If Carroll was slightly at fault for the opener, he makes up for it here. Welbeck breaks clear in the box to the left of goal, and dinks a cross back into the centre, where Nani hammers a shot straight into the ground. It bounces up and looks like squeaking under the crossbar, but Carroll, who had initially been closing Welbeck down on his right, comes back across and tips spectacularly over the bar. From the corner: nada.</p><!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Addison has been shown the yellow card for some foul or other I missed.</p><!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Tevez loses out in a tussle with Todd and is penalised for an illegal shove. In anger he hammers the ball into the stand - for which he really should have been booked. But somehow isn't. It's almost as though Rafael Benitez had some sort of point.</p><!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Davies dinks the ball past Rafael, who slides in needlessly down the left. Davies is clear in the box but, with Hulse and Commons in the centre, hammers a hopeless cross-cum-shot high into the stand.</p><!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 min: WELL, THIS IS OVER. Manchester United 3-0 Derby County (agg 3-1).</strong> Rafael picks the ball up on the right and sends a slightly outswinging ball into the six-yard box. It's a peach of a cross, right on Tevez's head - and the United striker can't miss from that range, thrashing his header home. And what were Derby's defenders doing? A hahahahahaha. A hahahahahahahahahaha.</p><!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Stewart heads weakly out. Rafael returns it first time to Giggs, who lays it immediately back from whence it came, allowing the young right back to tear into the area. His powerful shot nearly finds the top-right corner - but not quite, billowing the side netting instead. ""President Obama (doesn't that feel nice?) is reputed to be a West Ham fan,"" notes Gary Naylor. ""I wonder if he'll find time to voice an opinion on Craig Bellamy? If he does, it might spoil the big-hugs ambience of the day. Having said that, peace and prosperity to all men except Craig Bellamy sounds a winning sentiment to me.""</p><!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Neville gives away a cheap free kick 25 yards out. It's fairly central, just to the left. Commons sends a curler in the general direction of the top-left corner, but it's high and wide and not troubling either the goal or Foster.</p><!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Rafael has picked up some sort of injury. Hobbling off, he's replaced by Fletcher. Meanwhile Teale embarks on a long run up the right-hand side of the pitch. For a split second he's got a chance to send Commons free on goal, but decides to slap a daisycutter towards the bottom-left corner. Foster has it easily covered.</p><!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Davies diddles Fletcher down the left and cuts inside. Again his decision making when in space is dreadful, and he dithers, allowing Evans to come to him at the edge of the area and block the eventual shot.</p><!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>HALF (THOUGH IT MIGHT AS WELL BE FULL) TIME: Manchester United 3-0 Derby County (agg 3-1).</strong> Some good work from Green, who manages to rob Giggs, immediately lose the ball to Fletcher, then rob Fletcher, before sending Stewart scuttling off down the left. It looks for a moment like a dangerous cross can be swung in towards Commons and Hulse, but Stewart is ponderous and Anderson comes across to put a stop to any fancy ideas he may have had. And that's us three-quarters through a tie which is already over.</p><!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>And we're off again! This time with added Robbie Savage!</strong> The ""former Manchester United player"", who never actually played for Manchester United, replaces Davies, who has groin knack. ""I think the Bellamy shout-out that Gary Naylor was looking for in Obama's speech today was the line about swearing oaths amidst gathering clouds and raging storms,"" writes Justin Kavanagh, who has certainly been paying more attention to the little piece of history which occurred in Washington today than your hapless MBM scribe. ""Robinho has the right idea - would you want to be on the same golf course as the Welsh whinger?""</p><!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Anderson scampers down the left and rolls a ball forward into the area, nearly springing Nani clear. Albrechtsen swans off with the ball.</p><!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Just to the right of the D, Nani shapes to shoot - and is crudely upended by Savage. Giggs whips the resulting free kick towards the top-right corner, but his effort is brilliantly pawed away by Carroll for a corner. Of which there are two, nothing coming from either.</p><!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Derby cause a little bit of trouble in the United area, Green swinging a cross in from the right which Evans can only half clear. The ball comes back in from Teale on the left, Hulse heading lamely out of play while trying to flick the ball on towards Commons at the far post. That's better, though.</p><!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Nani sends Tevez clear into the area, allowing the Argentinian to sidefoot the ball past the advancing Carroll and into the bottom-right corner. But it won't stand: the Derby offside trap was staunch this time, Todd running out at exactly the right time as Nani faffed around with the initial pass.</p><!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Welbeck, running at speed down the inside left channel, stumbles over Albrechtsen's outstretched legs when about to burst clear on goal. That should probably have been a free kick in a dangerous position - but it's not given. Seconds later, Tevez scoots down the right and nearly sets up Giggs and Welbeck in the centre. The ball's cleared - but this is in danger of turning into a rout. ""Surely the Bellamy reference in Obama's speech was when he said he is willing to 'extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist'?"" wonders Lucas Whitworth.</p><!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> As if things aren't bad enough for Derby at the moment, Giggs is replaced by Ronaldo.</p><!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Neville so nearly suffers the indignity of a comic own goal, sliding in to deflect Hulse's hard, low cross from the right <em>inches</em> wide of the left-hand post. Derby will need a lot more of this if they want to get back into this game.</p><!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Commons is down getting attention to a massive gash in his shin. ""Has any player ever been as unjustifiably, universally loathed as Robbie Savage?"" asks Adam Hirst. ""All he ever did was run around a lot and bump into people, it hardly puts him in the Dennis Wise category of despisable footballers. I always quite admired the way he was rubbish but honest and keen. Plus he likes darts."" Yeah, I'm with you on this one. He's just about the only Premier League footballer from the last two decades who doesn't take himself terribly, terribly seriously.</p><!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Todd is replaced by Barazite.</p><!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Neville is replaced by Chester.</p><!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> What a chance for Green, who gets on the end of a dropping ball eight yards out but wellies it miles over the United bar. Such a shame Derby couldn't have kept it tighter in the first half, and made a game of this.</p><!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Barnes is on for Commons.</p><!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Ronaldo cuts inside from the right and has a dig from 25-odd yards, but it's not particularly good, Carroll swallowing the weak effort with ease.</p><!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Connolly whips a fierce cross in from the right, finding Hulse eight yards out. Hulse should score - but doesn't, sending his powerful header just above the bar. Foster was never stopping that if it was on target, unless it crumped straight into his face.</p><!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Evans is limping around quite a lot, which is a slight worry for United as they've used up all their subs.</p><!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>79 min: PENALTY FOR DERBY!</strong> Green latches onto a ball heading towards the byline to the right of goal. He jinks back and is upended by Evans, sliding in. The ref takes less than 0.000000000001 second to blow his whistle and point to the spot. Barnes steps up, and...</p><!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>80 min: GOAL! Manchester United 3-1 Derby County (agg 3-2).</strong> ...scores! High into the top left, though Foster goes the right way. This is suddenly on!</p><!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> And so nearly suddenly off again! A clever ball from Nani into the area suddenly finds Ronaldo clear, just left of centre in the box. He hits the ball low and hard, but it's kicked clear by Carroll - who then parries Nani's curling effort away too! A great response to a sudden shock from United.</p><!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Now Ronaldo whips a free kick from the right just wide of Carroll's left-hand post.</p><!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Super end-to-end stuff now. A wonderful ball slid wide right by Gibson springs Ronaldo clear, but Stewart tracks back well and blocks. Then up the other end Barnes skitters down the left and slides the ball across to Barazite, who sends a low shot towards the bottom-left corner, Foster getting down well to gather.</p><!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>86 min: PENALTY FOR UNITED!</strong> Tevez tears clear into the box, Derby's back line all over the shop again. Carroll comes out. Tevez rounds him on the left, and is upended by the keeper. No question about the decision, nor is there one over Carroll's booking. Ronaldo steps up to take and...</p><!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>88 min: GOAL! Manchester United 4-1 Derby County (agg 4-2).</strong> ... slots hard into the bottom left, after having to wait an age as Nani enjoyed a bit of a rub-down from the physio. Carroll nearly got a hand to it, but Ronaldo's execution was so precise the ball was always heading for the back of the net.</p><!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Anyway, Robbie Savage. ""Sav was capable of delivering pretty decent corners,"" opines Amy Kennebec. ""Damned by faint praise, perhaps, but I've always liked him and seen him as a less-talented Gino Gattuso."" Eh? Tom Hopkins adds: ""I'm kind of with Adam Hirst on the Savage thing (annoying though he can be). If nothing else, he's worked hard and made the most of his talent. On that basis, he's done a lot more than say Jermaine Pennant or Kieron Dyer.""</p><!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 4-2 Derby County (agg 4-3).</strong> Old Trafford rings to the sound of Que Sera Sera. Derby are awarded a free kick 25 yards out, just to the left of centre. Barnes stands over the ball, then sends a delightful curling right-then-left effort low towards the bottom left. The ball beats Foster's grasping hand, clips the bottom of the post - and into the net. An amazing finish to this game!</p><!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Manchester United 4-2 Derby County (agg 4-3).</strong> A spot of head tennis on the edge of the United area causes an almost audible collective sucking of teeth by the Old Trafford faithful, but the ball is eventually hacked clear - slightly desperately, it must be said - and, as it bounces into Derby's unpopulated half of the pitch, the whistle is blown. Even though that was a great second-half effort by Derby, it was too little, too late: they were never coming back from their first-half capitulation. So Manchester United are going to Wembley, where they will face either Tottenham Hotspur or Burnl... yeah, Spurs. Meanwhile shall we put Derby's Homeric efforts during that second period solely down to the introduction of Robbie Savage? Yes, let's. Especially if it annoys people.</p>",2812,false,2024-04-15T13:30:10Z,UK,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/p/24tc3,false,true,https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/1/7/1231366814806/Kris-Commons-001.jpg,false,en,true,"Can Nigel Clough lead Derby County to the club's first major trophy since their early-to-mid-seventies heyday, a glorious era kickstarted by his father? Let's face it, probably not. But surely there's nobody with a warm heart beating in their chest, outside of Nottingham and Leicester, who wouldn't like to hear such a fairytale told. Is there? I mean, even trophy-laden Manchester United fans can't desire another League Cup bauble that much, can they? Kick off is at 8pm; we'll get this report up and running when the teams come in just after 7pm. United's second string are almost bound to prevail, but remember: Derby hold a 1-0 aggregate lead after Kris Commons' Pride Park howitzer in the first leg, so a shock isn't totally beyond the realms of possibility. And speaking of Derby's glory days, why not read Rob 'Bob' Smyth's excellent piece on the story of Derby's 1974/75 title success under Dave Mackay? A Manchester United representative XI, with £8m Zoran Tosic on the bench: Foster, Rafael Da Silva, Neville, Evans, O'Shea, Nani, Gibson, Anderson, Giggs, Welbeck, Tevez. Subs: Kuszczak, Ronaldo, Tosic, Scholes, Fletcher, Possebon, Chester. Derby County welcome Paul Connolly and Jordan Stewart back from suspension: Carroll, Connolly, Albrechtsen, Todd, Stewart, Teale, Addison, Green, Davies, Commons, Hulse. Subs: Bywater, Savage, Villa, Barnes, Nyatanga, Barazite, Hines. Ladies and gentlemen, the whistler from the Wirral... Mike Dean. And, without further ado, we're off! Derby kick off, and lose the ball within the first second. Dear me. Thankfully for all interested in some competition this evening, United immediately shank it straight out of play themselves. 2 min: Rafael zips past Stewart down the right, but after creating space can only wallop his cross into the side netting. 4 min: A nice open flowing game here. Derby, through Commons and Hulse, enjoy a brief sortie down the right, then United stream forward straight down the middle, Giggs and Welbeck nearly combining to release Nani into the area. Todd steps in to clear. Meanwhile here's a nod to topicality from ""lapsed Derby fan"" Tom Hopkins. ""I've got to say that (based on very little evidence) I'm totally buying into the Clough Mark II thing. He's the white Obama!"" It's like TW3 never went off the air round here. 6 min: You know that goal Commons scored in the first leg? Well that would have looked like a tap-in had this gone in. Gibson gives the ball away with a lazy crossfield pass, allowing Derby to break forward quickly. Hulse's forward pass looks like being cut out by Evans on the halfway line, but Commons robs him and charges down the inside-left channel. He's only got one thing on his mind, and when at least 35 yards out, hits a swerving, dipping shot which flies wide of the left-hand post. But only just. A very decent effort indeed. 10 min: Another decent forward thrust by Derby, as Neville is robbed by Stewart down the left. Stewart tears off into the United half. Neville comes back him, but is diddled by a little stop-start trick. Stewart is in acres, but his deep cross is aimed nowhere in particular and Evans clears calmly. This is a nice confident start by the visitors, who may well have decided there is bugger all to lose, so they may as well have a go. 13 min: United aren't really clicking up front. Tevez and Giggs are trying their best to prompt, and Welbeck has enjoyed a couple of determined runs towards the box, but everything's being dealt with by Todd and Albrechtsen in the centre. 16 min: GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Derby County (agg 1-1). This is pretty spectacular from United's persepective: Nani picks the ball up just inside the Derby half, cuts inside, drops a shoulder to skate past the challenge of Teale, and from a good 25 yards out to the left, arrows a screamer into the top-right corner. However from Derby's... well, who was making a challenge? And Carroll got a hand to the ball and - though the shot was travelling at pace - may think he should have done better. 19 min: Rafael is booked for a pretty crude lunge on Davies out on the Derby left. The free kick is kind of wasted, but the ball soon comes back at United, Neville being forced to cushion a clever header back to Foster when under severe pressure from Commons and Addison. 21 min: United are passing it around. A lot. 22 min: GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Derby County (agg 2-1). Terrible defending by Derby here. Tevez rolls a ball across the face of goal from the left. Welbeck immediately prods it forward into the box - where O'Shea should be caught offside, but Derby's back line is such a state that he's played miles on by the lumbering Teale, and has plenty of time to dig the pass out from under his feet and prod the ball past the advancing Carroll and into the net. 25 min: United are passing it around again.

By <strong>Ashley Seager</strong>, <strong>Jill Treanor </strong>and <strong>David Gow</strong></p>",,"<p>John McFall, confidant of Gordon Brown and chairman of the Treasury select committee, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland tonight after shares in both banks crumbled, the pound skidded to a seven-year low against the dollar and government bonds were sold off sharply.</p> <p>As markets took fright at the state of Britain's banking sector and the wider economy the day after the government's latest bail-out plan, shares in the loss-making RBS slumped to 10.3p, continuing Monday's 66% slide, while the new Lloyds Banking Group continued to fall rapidly as it looked likely that many UK banks would not be paying any dividends for years.</p> <p>McFall, an influential Labour MP, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland ""for the sake of financial stability"". In an article in the Financial Times co-authored by the veteran private equity expert Jon Moulton, McFall said: ""Let us get it over with – nationalise the pair of them.""</p> <p>The pound fell to $1.386, hitting the lowest point since June 2001. It also slumped below €1.07. Sterling was not helped by a surge of confidence in the dollar, as Barack Obama was sworn in as US president.</p> <p>Jim Rogers, a veteran US investor, said the UK economy was ""finished"". He told Bloomberg: ""I would urge you to sell any sterling. It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK.""</p> <p>Rumours were awash in febrile markets that ratings agencies could downgrade the UK's sovereign debt ratings if the government had to issue tens of billions of pounds of government bonds to finance its latest rescue for the banks. A downgrade would increase the cost of raising debt for Britain, the world's fifth largest economy. The price of insuring British debt against default also rose sharply.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor, was forced in Brussels to dismiss market talk that he, like Denis Healey in 1976, would have to turn to the IMF for a bail-out, saying he had laid out at the pre-budget report in November how he intended to pay for the government's schemes.</p> <p>But Peer Steinbrück, Germany's finance minister, also at the EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels, said he and others had urged a swift return to sound public finances and expressed fears about the situation in Britain, which is forecast to have a 9.5% budget deficit next year, and Ireland, whose deficit in 2010 is put at 13%.</p> <p>Saying he did not understand Darling's scheme to insure UK banks' multibillion-pound toxic assets via the Bank of England and a ""bad bank"", he said: ""I am sceptical that a national scheme will work.""</p> <p>Steinbrück echoed market fears about the UK scheme by saying it was unclear how to find the right price for the securities in a bad bank. The bank might have to be capitalised with up to 30% of what was on lenders' balance sheets – up to €200bn.</p> <p>The bail-out also worries the City. ""The market rightly fears the long-term fiscal costs of a collapsing banking system,"" said Graham Turner, of consultancy GFC Economics. The gilts market was spooked by the potential costs to the public purse. Gilts prices fell sharply on the fear of greater supply, which in turn pushed yields up to 3.55% for a 10-year benchmark gilt. Falling yields recently have helped bring down the price of some corporate borrowing and fixed-rate mortgages.</p> <p>Shares in Lloyds lost half their value before ending 31% lower at 44.8p. Lloyds' stockmarket value is just £6bn – barely half the sum put in by the taxpayer. RBS, soon to be almost 70% state-owned after a £20bn cash injection, has a stockmarket value of less than £4bn. In 2007 it was worth £78bn. Barclays was also hit hard, touching 69p before ending 17% down at 72.9p, to be worth £6bn – little more than the £5.3bn of profits it expects for 2008 and down from £58bn 18 months ago.</p> <p>Even HSBC, the UK's biggest bank and the only one not to have raised funds from investors, was caught in the rout.

As markets took fright at the state of Britain's banking sector and the wider economy the day after the government's latest bail-out plan, shares in the loss-making RBS slumped to 10.3p, continuing Monday's 66% slide, while the new Lloyds Banking Group continued to fall rapidly as it looked likely that many UK banks would not be paying any dividends for years. McFall, an influential Labour MP, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland ""for the sake of financial stability"". In an article in the Financial Times co-authored by the veteran private equity expert Jon Moulton, McFall said: ""Let us get it over with – nationalise the pair of them."" The pound fell to $1.386, hitting the lowest point since June 2001. It also slumped below €1.07. Sterling was not helped by a surge of confidence in the dollar, as Barack Obama was sworn in as US president. Jim Rogers, a veteran US investor, said the UK economy was ""finished"". He told Bloomberg: ""I would urge you to sell any sterling. It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK."" Rumours were awash in febrile markets that ratings agencies could downgrade the UK's sovereign debt ratings if the government had to issue tens of billions of pounds of government bonds to finance its latest rescue for the banks. A downgrade would increase the cost of raising debt for Britain, the world's fifth largest economy. The price of insuring British debt against default also rose sharply. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, was forced in Brussels to dismiss market talk that he, like Denis Healey in 1976, would have to turn to the IMF for a bail-out, saying he had laid out at the pre-budget report in November how he intended to pay for the government's schemes. But Peer Steinbrück, Germany's finance minister, also at the EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels, said he and others had urged a swift return to sound public finances and expressed fears about the situation in Britain, which is forecast to have a 9.5% budget deficit next year, and Ireland, whose deficit in 2010 is put at 13%. Saying he did not understand Darling's scheme to insure UK banks' multibillion-pound toxic assets via the Bank of England and a ""bad bank"", he said: ""I am sceptical that a national scheme will work."" Steinbrück echoed market fears about the UK scheme by saying it was unclear how to find the right price for the securities in a bad bank. The bank might have to be capitalised with up to 30% of what was on lenders' balance sheets – up to €200bn. The bail-out also worries the City. ""The market rightly fears the long-term fiscal costs of a collapsing banking system,"" said Graham Turner, of consultancy GFC Economics. The gilts market was spooked by the potential costs to the public purse. Gilts prices fell sharply on the fear of greater supply, which in turn pushed yields up to 3.55% for a 10-year benchmark gilt. Falling yields recently have helped bring down the price of some corporate borrowing and fixed-rate mortgages. Shares in Lloyds lost half their value before ending 31% lower at 44.8p. Lloyds' stockmarket value is just £6bn – barely half the sum put in by the taxpayer. RBS, soon to be almost 70% state-owned after a £20bn cash injection, has a stockmarket value of less than £4bn. In 2007 it was worth £78bn. Barclays was also hit hard, touching 69p before ending 17% down at 72.9p, to be worth £6bn – little more than the £5.3bn of profits it expects for 2008 and down from £58bn 18 months ago. Even HSBC, the UK's biggest bank and the only one not to have raised funds from investors, was caught in the rout. It fell 3% to a stockmarket value of about £58bn – less than half the £120bn it was valued at before the credit crunch began. Darling insisted he had won backing in Brussels for the bail-out. EU ministers said: ""Member states continue to remain committed to taking all necessary steps."" He said the statement proposed to the EU's Czech presidency by Britain – which demands the proper functioning of credit channels through banks' use of their capital reserves – showed EU unity. News that UK inflation had its biggest fall in 17 years, dropping to 3.1% in December from 4.1% a month before, did little to calm markets, partly because it had been expected to fall further, but also because the Bank of England has already slashed interest rates to a historic low of 1.5% and is widely expected to cut them further. Mervyn King, Bank governor, paved the way last night for ""quantitative easing"" – radical steps to combat deflation and thaw credit markets – by promising to start buying corporate bonds and other assets within ""weeks, not months"", to pump cash into the system. In a speech to the CBI in Nottingham, he said the Bank was ready to take ""unconventional measures"" to kick-start the economy, once the weapon of interest rate cuts was exhausted. King said as well as buying bonds and other securities (to raise reserves on banks' balance sheets and encourage them to lend) the Bank would also consider buying particular classes of assets where markets were malfunctioning. He also threw his weight behind Alistair Darling's new rescue package for the banking sector. A minister has admitted that the centre-piece of the rescue – the scheme to insure banks against unexpected losses – may last nine years. The admission made by the City minister, Lord Myners, contrasts with Gordon Brown's claim on Monday that the scheme would be short-lived. Myners told peers: ""We are probably talking about a policy duration of no fewer than five years, and probably no longer than eight or nine years … we need a policy that will take financial markets through this economic downturn and beyond."" Inflation is widely expected to turn to deflation this year as the recession deepens and the impact of falling oil prices feeds fully into the figure. Oil prices fell as low as $32.70 a barrel yesterday, partly on the resumption of Russian gas supplies and partly due to renewed strength in the dollar. That is barely a fifth of the record level hit last summer. The FTSE 100, though, was little moved overall, closing at 4091.17 points on the day as firming pharmaceutical, tobacco and oil shares counterbalanced the losses in bank shares.

Did you expect the Day 'N' Nite remix to be such a success?</strong><br>I remember when I recorded it, I told my homeboy 'O Dot, who produced the track: ""This is going to be a No 1 track in some country. I don't know what country, but it's going to take off somewhere."" He was like: ""I don't know about all that. It is a good record – but No 1?"" I believed in the track but it was still my dream that it would take off in the way that way it has. It ended up blowing up not because of any label, investment or corporations pushing it, but because it created a buzz on its own. That's the best feeling, that people naturally took to the record, they connected to it. It's overwhelming, but it's also a dream come true.</p> <p><strong>When you say No 1 in some country, did you not anticipate America taking to it?</strong><br>Well, yeah because it was different. I really felt nobody in America was going to rock with it and then I started to have doubts about putting it out. I'd rather be known as an MC and I was worried that if I put this out first then they wouldn't see me like that because I was singing. That was me being self-conscious about what people would think. Ultimately, I decided ""fuck that"" and did what I wanted to. </p> <p><strong>Like the Kanye mentality?</strong><br>Yeah, but this was pre-808s &amp; Heartbreak and pre-Graduation, pre-Stronger. I recorded it before anything that was the next level in hip-hop, especially on an underground level. I've always been ahead of the curve when it came to trying new stuff in the underground scene. I've always felt that because I'm from Cleveland, which isn't recognised as a place for hip-hop, I needed to step it up if I wanted to make myself known. I worked things out and I've found my vibe – although I'm reinventing myself with every new song.</p> <p><strong>Kanye has said in interviews that you inspire him. That must be flattering?</strong><br>Yeah, yeah ... it's dope because Kanye has really been helping out. It's overwhelming how supportive he's been. People always have negative things to say about him. And now when I hear those negative things, I take that shit personally. I'm like, ""Nah, you're wrong, this dude is seriously cool"". </p> <p><strong>You think he is misunderstood?</strong><br>Yeah, but if you're not doing what everyone else is doing then your going to be misunderstood. People are going to wonder why you're trying to be different; it's just a natural instinct. If I was to walk down the street in a kilt then dudes would wonder why I'm doing that, they'd think I was different or gay. It's natural for people to point fingers. That's my whole reason for trying to switch things up; don't judge a book by it's cover. My background is not typical hip-hop. I didn't grow up in the projects. I grew up in a single family home in a middle-class suburb. That doesn't mean I didn't experience hardship, but to me it's not about that, it's about the future and where we are trying to take it. <br><strong><br>Have you felt misunderstood by the music industry?</strong><br>Yeah, a lot. I mean from all angles. Some people just don't want to see change but thankfully there are a lot of people more optimistic for something new in music, even with the bigger picture like with Obama getting elected. The world is changing so people are more open-minded about things than they were, say, 10 years ago. </p> <p><strong>Is it true you recorded Day 'N' Nite when you were not in a great place emotionally?</strong><br>Yeah. I was going through a lot of stuff at the time in my life and so I felt like I needed to write those things down just to get them off my chest. I wasn't really thinking about making a hit record or anything like that, I was just making the song to get my feelings out. That was the frame of mind I had when I created the song. It turned out really dope.</p> <p><strong>What was your initial reaction to the Crookers remix? </strong><br>I immediately loved it. I thought they did an amazing job. I didn't think it was going to be as ill as it was. Before I heard it I thought, ""Ah, it's techno so it's going to be cheesy"", but it came out really fucking ill.</p> <p><strong>Even though Crookers are from Italy, the remix sounds like the UK grime and bass-line scenes. Are you a fan? </strong><br>I'm familiar with them. I think they're dope and that's what music should be about: crossing over into different worlds and hitting people with something different.</p> <p><strong>Are there any other UK acts that you like?</strong><br>I spoke to Dizzee Rascal during the [Kanye West] Glow in the Dark tour. He came backstage. He was so cool. He's the only MC I really know from the UK so when I met him, I was like, ""Oh shit, it's Dizzee Rascal!"" [laughs]. DJ Semtex [BBC 1xtra] hooked us up. We exchanged numbers so hopefully we'll do some stuff together. He's dope. And he's got something to say, too. MIA came to the States and she blew up, and I think he will too. People just need to stop hating, man. Obviously, it's a different sound, even if it's just because of his accent but so what? People from the South that you can't even understand are making worldwide hits. </p> <p><strong>How did you handle being on the road with Kanye?</strong><br>The tour bus is always fun, and there's plenty of time to watch movies. Actually, Kanye introduced me to the movie Step Brothers. We were sitting there, watching it and clowning around – it was so funny, man. Me and Kanye have the same sense of humour: that whole Will Ferrell, really silly, wise-ass humour, so we be clowning.<br><strong><br>What can you tell us about your forthcoming album?</strong><br>I've been telling everybody it's going to be the most magnificent album of 2009 and that's just what it is [laughs]. You know what I mean? I'm not going to say: ""It's the greatest album of our time."" But people do need to be ready for it.

Thankfully, though, we still have Kaka fall-out, Kaka-debrief and Kaka-shakedown to get us through these difficult times. Even better, we've also got Manchester City executive chairman - and Thaksin's golfing partner - Gary Cook. ""If you want my personal opinion they [Milan] bottled it,"" Cook raged this morning, a turn of phrase that could equally describe the way in which all five members of Girls Aloud have repeatedly ""bottled"" an open invitation to an evening in at The Fiver's bijou urban rafter space eating corned beef out of the can and playing Star Wars: The Clone Wars Top Trumps.</p> <p>""There were questions that were asked that they then couldn't answer,"" Cook explained. These questions presumably included (a) what do you mean, what are we doing here?; (b) can you call upstairs again, they're definitely expecting us?; and (c) well, is it OK if we just wait in reception then? Cook also revealed that City never actually met Kaka, which made it ""very difficult for him to turn down Manchester City"" (although not impossible). This despite assorted shark-faced City suits flying to Milan four times, apparently just to rap with Kaka's dad about dolphins. ""We talked a lot about a humanitarian approach and also environmental issues and the statements his son would like to make around the world,"" Cook explained. ""It's a shame he won't be able to join us on our journey."" Which, right now, looks like involving away trips to Blackpool and Doncaster next season.</p> <p>Also on an exciting journey today, it's Robinho, who has given City's mid-season trip to Tenerife the swerve - although if the Fiver's own experiences are anything to go by, this might be because he doesn't like being attacked by radioactive cockroaches while 17 bright-red Englishmen all called Vince violently initiate a pool-side conga. Not to worry though. Mid-air on his way back to Brazil, Robinho has already texted his excuses (""a family matter"") and explained that he's still ""committed to helping Manchester City become the farce the owners assured me they will become."" What's that? Oh, right. Force.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>""It is totally out of the question. He won't go to the Championship"" - Aston Villa substitute and Homer Simpson lookalike Marlon Harewood's Mr 15%, Phil Sproson, rules out any chance of his client moving to Sheffield United. Or Tottenham. Or Newcastle United. Or Manchester City. Etc, and so on, and so forth.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>YOUNG MAN, YOUNG MAN...</strong></p> <p>Last year, a bronze statue of Brian Clough was unveiled in Nottingham. Fastidiously lifelike, it depicts Clough with his arms clasped above his head in triumph, and will be toppled off its pedestal in about 15 years time so it can roll away down the street on its own into the nearest gutter. No such tribute has yet been erected in Derby, the scene of Clough's other great triumph, however. Which may go some way to explaining why, a couple of weeks ago, Derby County decided to install a special living, breathing, moving reminder of their greatest manager in the interim.</p> <p>The Rams' new monument-manager is already doing sterling work in ensuring nobody forgets what a gloriously chippy sod Clough was. Cloughie's Young Lad Nigel (to give him his full official name) had already told most of his players, Leeds '74-style, that they are effing hopeless, and useless t'boot. ""Some of the basic things on Saturday, any player in the lower leagues wouldn't have made those mistakes,"" he ranted after Derby's 2-0 defeat to QPR last weekend, suggesting that few of his Championship squad could hold a candle to his former Conference charges at Burton.</p> <p>And now, ahead of Derby's League Cup visit to Old Trafford this evening, he's dishing out backhanded compliments to figures of authority. ""There are certain similarities,"" he sighed when being asked to compare his dad, who won two European Cups on a budget of 23p, with Sir Alex Ferguson, who hasn't. ""I don't think there are too many Labour supporters among football managers these days, which they both were,"" sniffed CYNL, one casual use of the past tense laying to waste the lapsed socialist of the realm and defender of the Glazers, much like his dad totally owned Don Revie.</p> <p>An impressive start in his role as walking museum, but on-pitch success is another thing entirely and Ferguson is likely to have the last laugh tonight. For while his Manchester United side will contain kids like Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck, and may also feature John O'Shea if Ferguson is really chancing his arm, Derby could be forced to rely on Robbie Savage, 83. ""Let's not beat about the bush - everyone is fearing my legs have probably gone,"" was Savage's rallying cry. Oh dear: when you consider Clough's Burton side only lost 5-0 when they went to Old Trafford a couple of years ago, this doesn't exactly augur well, does it?</p> <p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/20/manchester-united-derby-county-carling-cup-semi-final-second-leg-live-minute-by-minute"">Follow Derby's shock 3-0 win, a prediction which totally contradicts the story you've just read, from 7.30pm with Scott Murray here.</a></p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Saudi Arabian side Al Nasr are ready to put an end to Egyptian midfielder Hossam Ghaly's White Hart Lane pain.</p> <p>Paul Ince is going to Norwich.

Thankfully, though, we still have Kaka fall-out, Kaka-debrief and Kaka-shakedown to get us through these difficult times. Even better, we've also got Manchester City executive chairman - and Thaksin's golfing partner - Gary Cook. ""If you want my personal opinion they [Milan] bottled it,"" Cook raged this morning, a turn of phrase that could equally describe the way in which all five members of Girls Aloud have repeatedly ""bottled"" an open invitation to an evening in at The Fiver's bijou urban rafter space eating corned beef out of the can and playing Star Wars: The Clone Wars Top Trumps. ""There were questions that were asked that they then couldn't answer,"" Cook explained. These questions presumably included (a) what do you mean, what are we doing here?; (b) can you call upstairs again, they're definitely expecting us?; and (c) well, is it OK if we just wait in reception then? Cook also revealed that City never actually met Kaka, which made it ""very difficult for him to turn down Manchester City"" (although not impossible). This despite assorted shark-faced City suits flying to Milan four times, apparently just to rap with Kaka's dad about dolphins. ""We talked a lot about a humanitarian approach and also environmental issues and the statements his son would like to make around the world,"" Cook explained. ""It's a shame he won't be able to join us on our journey."" Which, right now, looks like involving away trips to Blackpool and Doncaster next season. Also on an exciting journey today, it's Robinho, who has given City's mid-season trip to Tenerife the swerve - although if the Fiver's own experiences are anything to go by, this might be because he doesn't like being attacked by radioactive cockroaches while 17 bright-red Englishmen all called Vince violently initiate a pool-side conga. Not to worry though. Mid-air on his way back to Brazil, Robinho has already texted his excuses (""a family matter"") and explained that he's still ""committed to helping Manchester City become the farce the owners assured me they will become."" What's that? Oh, right. Force. ********************* QUOTE OF THE DAY ""It is totally out of the question. He won't go to the Championship"" - Aston Villa substitute and Homer Simpson lookalike Marlon Harewood's Mr 15%, Phil Sproson, rules out any chance of his client moving to Sheffield United. Or Tottenham. Or Newcastle United. Or Manchester City. Etc, and so on, and so forth. ********************* YOUNG MAN, YOUNG MAN... Last year, a bronze statue of Brian Clough was unveiled in Nottingham. Fastidiously lifelike, it depicts Clough with his arms clasped above his head in triumph, and will be toppled off its pedestal in about 15 years time so it can roll away down the street on its own into the nearest gutter. No such tribute has yet been erected in Derby, the scene of Clough's other great triumph, however. Which may go some way to explaining why, a couple of weeks ago, Derby County decided to install a special living, breathing, moving reminder of their greatest manager in the interim. The Rams' new monument-manager is already doing sterling work in ensuring nobody forgets what a gloriously chippy sod Clough was. Cloughie's Young Lad Nigel (to give him his full official name) had already told most of his players, Leeds '74-style, that they are effing hopeless, and useless t'boot. ""Some of the basic things on Saturday, any player in the lower leagues wouldn't have made those mistakes,"" he ranted after Derby's 2-0 defeat to QPR last weekend, suggesting that few of his Championship squad could hold a candle to his former Conference charges at Burton. And now, ahead of Derby's League Cup visit to Old Trafford this evening, he's dishing out backhanded compliments to figures of authority. ""There are certain similarities,"" he sighed when being asked to compare his dad, who won two European Cups on a budget of 23p, with Sir Alex Ferguson, who hasn't. ""I don't think there are too many Labour supporters among football managers these days, which they both were,"" sniffed CYNL, one casual use of the past tense laying to waste the lapsed socialist of the realm and defender of the Glazers, much like his dad totally owned Don Revie. An impressive start in his role as walking museum, but on-pitch success is another thing entirely and Ferguson is likely to have the last laugh tonight. For while his Manchester United side will contain kids like Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck, and may also feature John O'Shea if Ferguson is really chancing his arm, Derby could be forced to rely on Robbie Savage, 83. ""Let's not beat about the bush - everyone is fearing my legs have probably gone,"" was Savage's rallying cry. Oh dear: when you consider Clough's Burton side only lost 5-0 when they went to Old Trafford a couple of years ago, this doesn't exactly augur well, does it? Follow Derby's shock 3-0 win, a prediction which totally contradicts the story you've just read, from 7.30pm with Scott Murray here. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Saudi Arabian side Al Nasr are ready to put an end to Egyptian midfielder Hossam Ghaly's White Hart Lane pain. Paul Ince is going to Norwich. Perhaps to shop, perchance to take over at Carrow Road. Who knows? Not us. Arsenal can whistle for Andrei Arshavin, as Inter are in in in for him him him. And here, have you heard of this bloke Kaka? He's off to Real Madrid now - who are in turn offloading Arjen Robben to Juventus. ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF Portsmouth magistrates have banned four men from attending football matches for three years after they pleaded guilty to shouting indecent chants at Portsmouth defender Sol Campbell. In news that's completely overshadowed the inauguration of Barack Obama as the first African American president of the United States, the FA has charged Newcastle United manager Joe Kinnear and his Hull City counterpart Phil Brown with improper conduct after their comical toe-to-toe set-to on the touchline at St James's Park last weekend. Walsall have appointed former Bradford and Wigan manager Chris Hutchings as their new manager on an 18-month contract, which is generous seeing as his previous two gigs only lasted 12 games each. And professional grave-digger and hard-done-by former Chelsea manager Avram Grant has turned down an approach to manage Bulgaria's national team after failing to agree on a mutually agreeable stipend. ********************* STILL WANT MORE? Barry Glendenning came in at 7am this morning to write the Rumour Mill, only to find somebody else had done it instead. Rather than lie down for a couple of hours worth of Zs in one of New Office's relaxation pods, he cranked out 502 words on Craig Bellamy's transfer to Manchester City instead. Rob Smyth's blog entitled The Forgotten Story ... Derby's Second League Title may come as a surprise to Fiver readers who weren't aware the Rams had any league titles. The football in Ligue U-u-u-u-u-u-u-n may be predictable, but the off-field shenanigans have increasingly come to resemble a cartoon fist-fight, says Ben Lyttleton. And there's more interest in tonight's League Cup semi-final second leg between Manchester United and Derby County in Serbia than there is in Manchester or Derby. Formation nerd Jonathan Wilson stops pushing Subbuteo men around a baize table with a tactics spatula for long enough to explain why. ********************* FIVER LETTERS ""Re: Padraic O'Conaire's M'Asal Beag Dubh (Fivers passim).
