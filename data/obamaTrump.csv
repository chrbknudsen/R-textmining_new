1,obama,"Obama inauguration: We will remake America, vows President Obama America's first black president promises to roll back Bush years and restore nation's moral standing Barack Hussein Obama, the US president ushered in a new era of Democratic rule today with a promise to begin rolling back the Bush years and restore the nation's moral standing in the world. The 44th US president, speaking in front of the biggest inauguration crowd in US history, said: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America."" Well over a million people, wrapped up against the winter cold, many of them in place since dawn, filled the Mall to see Obama sworn in as the first black president. A big proportion of the crowd was African-American, many having travelled from across the continent to witness the historic moment. Large numbers also took the opportunity to celebrate the departure of President George Bush, who leaves office with some of the lowest popularity ratings in recent US history. He was jeered as he emerged from the Capitol building for the inauguration ceremony. There were cheers as a helicopter carrying him to retirement took off from Capitol Hill an hour later. Obama's speech was frequently inspirational, though he failed to find a phrase that is likely to resound down the generations, as did Roosevelt and Kennedy. Much of his oratory turned into an indictment of the outgoing president. He focused on Bush's abandonment of basic legal and human rights after the 9/11 attacks, rejecting as false the now former president's choice of security or American ideals. One of his first acts will be to order the closure of the Guantánamo detention centre. Heralding his new administration as ""an era of responsibility"", he set out a New Deal-style programme to tackle the recession by building roads and bridges, electric grids and digital lines. His administration would also confront the country's failed education and health systems, restore science to its rightful place, and make environmental concerns a priority. In a passage that produced one of the biggest cheers of the day, he promised to engage with the world in a way that Bush had failed to. He had a message for people and governments around the world watching the inauguration: ""We are ready to lead once more."" He specifically mentioned reaching out to the Muslim world. Hinting at his willingness to engage with countries such as Iran and Syria, though he did not name them, he said: ""We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."" Obama, son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, throughout the election campaign tried to avoid making too much of the fact that he would become the first African-American president. But he could not disappoint those who had been born in the days of segregation and had travelled long distances to be present today. Knowing it was a special moment for those and other black Americans, he said what American liberty meant was that ""a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Obama began the day with a visit to St John's church, across the square from the White House and the traditional venue for presidents, before heading for coffee with the Bushes. The outgoing vice-president, Dick Cheney, did not turn up at the door to join in the greeting. He is in a wheelchair, apparently because he injured his back while removing boxes. Obama and Bush then left to travel in an armoured car to the Capitol for the inauguration ceremony. Joe Biden was first sworn in as vice-president. Then came the moment for Obama. He initially stumbled over his words as Chief Justice John Roberts began the oath-taking. With the new first lady, Michelle, holding the Bible, the same one used for the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, he smiled and then began again. Obama was sworn in at 12.05pm with Roberts appearing to take the blame for the glitch, apparently caused when he asked Obama to recite the historic words in slightly the wrong order. One of the few sad notes on a day of celebration was that Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, attending a post-inaugural lunch for Obama on Capitol Hill, had to be rushed to hospital. Kennedy has been fighting brain cancer. Obama said, ""Our prayers are with his family."" Elderly West Virginia senator Robert Byrd was also taken ill at the lunch. Security in the capital was much higher than for Bush's inauguration four years ago. There were 28,000 secret service agents, police and US national guard members on duty, about 50% more than last time.",2009-01-20T19:16:38Z,News
2,obama,"Obama from outer space Whether tweeting-heads on Twitter or CNN's satellite, inauguration media coverage stretched both technology and credulity Well before it all began at noon, as the stage filled up with dignitaries and the Mall filled up with cheering people, the rolling news channels were already vying for the love of the viewing audience waiting to see the 44th US president sworn into office. Fox News quickly established heavyweight political commentary on the whole proceeding, as well as fashion-forward commentary on the outfits of Malia and Sasha Obama: ""They look like little ladies, don't they? In their long … um … coats?"" wondered one weighty commenter, grasping for the correct drapery term for the garments. ""Yep, coats"" confirmed his sidekick. And admiring the academic qualifications of the new first lady: ""I am going to officially proclaim … Um … and this is just one man's view … that Michelle Obama looks stunning. Yep. She really looks after herself."" CNN were meanwhile promising something almost as new-media ground-shaking as their election night hologram - itself hailed the world over as the world's most pointless rolling news gimmick. ""We can exclusively reveal,"" said Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, breathlessly and repeatedly, ""We have commissioned a satellite picture of the oathswearing - so we can see how the inauguration would be viewed from SPACE!"". And then promised to bring it to us as soon as they could. We moved to the edge of our seats. And in the meantime, while waiting for the extra-terrestrial view, we flicked around and watched the serious news anchors celebrity-spotting on stage. ""There's Aretha Franklin - the 'first lady of soul' - there are three first ladies on this stage: Aretha Franklin's the first Lady of Soul"" - proving that there's nothing that can kill a witty comment as fast as repeating it on CNN just in case anyone didn't catch how witty it was the first time around. And very occasionally, a small, human touch: shots of a moving van outside the East door of the White House. CNN managed to catch it when there were people beetling around the back of it. Fox, by the time they cut back, only got a van. ""And the Bushes are moving their clothes and their tchotchkes (an American term for knick-knacks, basically). Those sitting at home with the captions on had the added bonus of seeing a confused subtitler describe the Bushes as having to move out their 'Trotskys', which might have changed the place of Bush in history, if it were true. It wasn't. On Twitter, messages marked with a ""#current"" were received and sorted by Al Gore's TV channel before being put up in a common people's commentary on the ceremony. ""Cheney's transition into Dr Strangelove is complete,"" Someone tweeted, as the outgoing VP was wheeled onto the stage, due to back problems (from either moving boxes or bending over the shredder, opinion was divided on the cause depending on who you were) Other messages were bounding with purest excitement. ""Yes. We. DID!"" came several, as the president-elect walked onto the stage. ""I've got 4 vid streams running, and it's still not enough"" said another. Topping them all was a Twitterer called TymJones: ""I've gotten older, and the joy of Christmas morning has started to fade. THIS MOMENT HAS BROUGHT IT BACK! I'm so happy!!!!!!!!"" - although we can only assume in a ""childlike joy"" way rather than a celebration of the coming-of-the-messiah way. Twitter, liveblogs and television commentary alike questioned the naming convention as ""George Walker Bush"" was welcomed on stage, followed sometime after by: ""Ladies and gentlemen: Barack H Obama!"" H? So much for claiming back the name Hussain for universal use, they all said: Hussains all over the world must have felt their shoulders sag a little at the copping out (though they might have cheered up 20 minutes later when his full name was used in the oath) And then cross-cultural misunderstandings abounded on worldwide multimedia when Aretha Franklin stood up to sing God Save The Queen, but got the words wrong. (Sorry - it's the conventional British joke that must always be made upon hearing My Country 'Tis Of Thee.) She did it, though, in inimitable Aretha fashion, 66-years-old, with a full gospel choir singing 'Ringringringringring!"" at appropriate moments behind her. ""I hope the hat at least gets to sing a verse"" someone tweeted. And it could have, at that - in fact the bow atop it should have had a hat all its own. As the crowd hushed to listen to four world-class musicians play a new piece by John ""That guy who wrote the theme from Star Wars"" Williams, the news anchors, scared of silence - or, worse still, allowing people to listen to the music and somehow involve themselves in the ceremony - talked in short punchy clichés over the music. Part way through, at 12 noon precisely, a big sign flashed up on CNN: ""FACT: Barack Obama became president: the constitution states his term begins at noon even without oath"" Man, someone always has to try and call it first, don't they? As the oath was taken, people rejoiced in their own individual ways in various streams on twitter: ""I couldn't feel more inspired to put both feet squarely into adulthood."" was one ""Ah the end of an error [sic]. I feel a dark shadow has lifted off the capitol. Oh wait, that's because Cheney is sitting down."" The speech started. Certain tweeting celebrities (and many others) cheered the references to the importance of science and the existence of atheists. Others cheered in general, or merely followed their own agenda: ""Best President since Martin Sheen?"" - said another. ""I hope this is over in time for me to catch All My Children,"" said one more person joining wholeheartedly in the passage of history. And this is where the internet comes into its own - in the ability to pay listen out for your own area of interest, large or small, and feel free to give your opinion on exactly how correct (or not) that was. ""I am offended as a libertarian … I am sorry, but the question IS whether government is too big!"" said one CurrentTV twitterer, determined not to let the excitement of the day stand in the way of maintaining a healthy debate on personal crusades. During the speech, the swichover of the White House website to a new shiny web 2.0 special, blogs, galleries and all, caused a ripple of excitement among online communities, though most put off having a proper look until after the speech itself was over. And, when it was - during the poem reading that proved once more through polite applause and puzzled internet commentary that people don't really like Official National Poetry that much (apart from a few pleased and dissenting voices: ""Inaugural poem - 'We encounter each other in words.' So true for us here on twitter,"" said one) - the net came to life with reaction, debate, and people seeking to capture their moment. Flickr was busy creating an open pool of people at, watching, and giving their reaction to the Inauguration. A tag cloud created by one flickr user of Obama's speech, highlighting the words that were used most often - New; Nation; World; Common. It said. An hour after the oaths and the speechifying had finished, we sat and patiently waited for that promised satellite image. If they were saving it up this long, we reckoned, it must be something special. ""It's going to be"" said Wolf, once more ""REALLY cool."" The new president sat down to an inaugural lunch with congress. ""The recipe page for today's lunch has been the most visited of the whole inauguration site!"" said Senator Diane Feinstein, intriguingly, in her introduction. And all the while, as the cameras left congress to a private lunch, the livebloggers on their webpages, the twitterers in their own little worlds, the anchors chuntered away in the studios: There goes President Bush's plane, they said. Here are the crowds lining the route of the parade yet to come. And … ""We're told there was some cloud cover, but you just wait - it's going to be VERY COOL"" said Wolf Blitzen, yet again, sounding like he was trying hard to reassure someone - though whether it was us or himself was hard to decide. Lunch ended, chilly crowds said happy things, bundled up in warm … coats? (Yep, coats!) behind barriers lining the roads, preparing for the motorcade. At home and in offices, people turned over their televisions in time for those soaps, and let the live streaming coverage from Washington fall back among the work-filled windows on their computer screen. But those who trust in Wolf sat, and waited, bottoms sore from perching so close to the edge of their chairs: because we weren't moving anywhere until we'd seen this thing From Outer Space. Because even though it was over two hours ago - and even though we'd seen it from every considerable angle already, and even though there was all that cloud cover he'd been told about: it was, we still believed, going to be COOL. [Update, three hours after the ceremony: Still waiting.] [Five hours later: satellite image spotted! It is like google maps but with extra added ants. Brilliant. Glad we waited. Can I go to the toilet now?]",2009-01-20T22:00:00Z,Opinion

5,obama,"Inaugural address of President Barack Obama Remarks as prepared for delivery by the 44th president of the United States My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet. These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness. In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labour, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise healthcare's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favours only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good. As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our founding fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honour them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: ""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."" America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.",2009-01-20T16:07:44Z,News
6,obama,"Liveblogging the inauguration of Barack Obama A minute-by-minute dispatch 10am (all times eastern): So much has been said and written about the significance of this moment. But now, finally -- hard though it is to believe -- here it is. At around 11.30am today, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American to hold the office. (A little after 12.30, he'll escort George Bush to a waiting helicopter; might we assume there will be cheering?) The atmosphere in Washington DC this morning, where millions of people are gathering to share the moment, is electric: inaugurations are always quasi-religious affairs, but never in living memory has one been as freighted with meaning as this. The day's full schedule is here; the Obamas have just arrived at the White House, where they're joining the Bushes and the achy-backed Dick Cheney and his wife for coffee, before proceeding to the capitol. Join me here imminently for history in the making, plus wisecracks. 10.05am: Here's how big the crowd is: the entire stretch of the Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol has now reportedly been closed. See the satellite image here for what a vast stretch of space that is: it's fourteen long city blocks, or more than a mile. 10.11am: Bringing an official start to proceedings, we're now listening to the US Marine Band. I feel sorry for the flautists and the clarinettists, who have to wear fingerless gloves so that they can use their instruments. The bass drum guy has it so easy by comparison. 10.18am: Senior diplomatic and military types arrive to take their VIP seats on the Capitol steps. Nope, I've no idea who most of them are. Magic Johnson did arrive a little earlier, though. Everyone already looks very, very cold, and they've got plenty of time left to sit there getting colder. (Smugly, I've come back into the warmth -- it's the only way to follow the proceedings up close and to liveblog this thing -- but I was there just before and let me tell you it was freezing.) 10.26am: Ben Smith notes the audacity of French socialist politician Segolene Royal, who this morning claims credit for having inspired Obama. His team copied hers, she explains (except for the bit about winning). 10.33am: While we're waiting... an amusing inaugural fact from 1829, when another ""people's president"", Andrew Jackson, tried to hold an ""open"" inauguration, albeit on a different scale to today's. ""About 20,000 people trample mud and horse manure into the White House, destroy rugs, break satin-covered chairs, smash crystal and china, and spill liquor. Fights break out, women faint and Jackson has to escape through a window. Order is restored when barrels of whiskey are placed on the South Lawn, drawing the crowd outside."" Back in 2009, senior congressional leaders are arriving on the steps. 10.37am: At the White House, the Obamas and the Bushes are finishing up their coffee -- what wouldn't you give to be a fly on the wall at that particular meeting? -- and any moment they'll enter two limousines, the men in one and the women in another, the departing president sitting on the right, the president-elect on the left. It's not a long journey from the White House to the Capitol, even when the roads aren't cleared and empty for you, so we'll expect to see them arrive minutes later. 10.40am: Many great comments below -- do read them. Ted Kennedy arrives, thereby answering the question of whether he'd be well enough to attend. John Kerry and George HW Bush follow on; it's a dignitary bonanza up there! 10.43am: Jill Biden and Lynn Cheney leave the White House and step into a waiting limo, followed by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. ... And Joe Biden and, in a wheelchair, Dick Cheney, who injured his back yesterday moving into his new home. 10.48am: Two significant moments, almost simultaneous: at one end of the city, at the Capitol, John McCain arrives to watch the man who defeated him get sworn in, and at the other, Obama and Bush step out to the north portico of the White House to loud cheers. (Who knew Bush was so well-loved?) 10.53am: What must it be like to be Bush today, and to look down the Mall, as he will a little later, and see millions of people clamouring not only in support of your successor, but also for you to leave? I suspect Bush may be as relieved as anyone that he's leaving power today, but the man's internal life continues to baffle and fascinate. I don't mean to sound sympathetic, but... 10.59am: How they're welcoming Obama in Puri, India: a three-tonne sand sculpture. 11.05am: It's amusing, and rather touching, to see how many of the bigshot senators and other political figures are clutching digital cameras, snapping away, recording the moment. 11.08am: My colleague Richard Adams, who nabbed himself a good seat for today's events, and who is a show-off, texts to say he just ran into Al Franken on the way to the bathroom, but that Franken was too busy to stop to have his photograph taken. He's doubtless using every last minute to raise funds for his Minnesota court case. Meanwhile, Al and Tipper Gore arrive. [UPDATE: I misread Richard's text. This happened to someone sitting near him, not to him...] 11.17am: The Carters arrive... and the Clintons. And then someone really important, Rahm Emanuel, who will basically be the second most powerful person in the world within the hour. Meanwhile we learn that, following tradition, Bush left Obama a note in the White House. ""The White House today declined to provide intimate details of the message the two-term Republican left for the incoming Democrat, saying only that Bush wrote it on Monday and left it in the top drawer of his desk."" Your guesses? 11.20am: Chaos on the DC metro as a woman falls from a platform onto the track, closing two major stations. (They've now reopened.) At the White House, currently unoccupied by any president, moving crews are unloading boxes of Obama's stuff -- it's a lightning-fast operation. 11.25am: Here are Sasha and Malia Obama, in blue and pink winter coats respectively, and a roar carries down the Mall -- first, the people who are close by, then those watching on screens a long way away. 11.31am: Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are in their seats. And now here's Bush arriving at the Capitol, looking oddly apprehensive. ""No more Bush! No more Bush!"" chant the crowd, though they haven't seen Bush on the jumbotron screens yet, I don't think. 11.37am: ...Aaaand Bush and Cheney are announced to a military fanfare, accompanied by congressional leaders, and now a rendition of Hail To The Chief. Up on the Capitol steps, it's all smiles and polite applause, of course. Not so up by the Washington Monument, I'll warrant. 11.39am: Biden is announced, to raucous flagwaving. Backstage, there's footage of Obama walking through the Capitol building, looking even more completely sober and calm than usual, which is saying something. Though on second thoughts, maybe there's something in the cast of his expression this morning that speaks of the pressure he's under. He seems to be holding himself in. Any moment now, he'll walk into the cold open air. 11.43am: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect of the United States, Barack H. Obama."" The Mall explodes. For a moment on the carpeted staircase, Obama looks very slight, small, and solitary. But it only lasts a moment; now he's back in his element, shaking hands and taking his seat. 11.45am: Dianne Feinstein takes to the podium for her call to order. ""The world is watching today as our great democracy engages in this peaceful transition of power... we gather to etch another line in the solid stone of history. The freedom of a people to choose its leaders is the root of liberty. In a world where political strife is too often settled with violence, we come here every four years to bestow the power of the presidency upon our democratically elected leader... Future generations will mark this morning as the turning-point for real and necessary change in our nation. They will look back and remember that this is the moment when the dream that once echoed across history from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial finally reached the walls of the White House."" 11.48am: Here's the controverial evangelical pastor Rick Warren to provide the invocation. The invocation won't be controversial, you can be sure, though. Eyes are closed up and down the Mall. (Obama's too.) ""We celebrate a hinge point of history, with the inauguration of our first African-American president of the United States. We are so grateful to live in this land... where the son of an African immigrant can rise to the highest levels of our leadership."" Dr King is ""shouting in heaven"" he says. ""Help us to remember that we are Americans related not by religion or race or blood but by our commitment to freedom and justice for all... We now commit our new president and his wife Michelle, and his daughters Malia and Sasha, into your loving care."" He concludes with the Lord's Prayer. 11.53am: They're going to have to get through the rest of the ceremony pretty fast: Biden has to be sworn in first, but in accordance with the constitution, Obama has to take the oath by noon at the latest. We're running a good 20-25 minutes late compared to the official announced schedule. 11.54am: And yet first here's Aretha Franklin, approaching the podium to sing My Country Tis Of Thee, accompanied by the marine band. Which is, of course, our own beloved British national anthem. Only with different words. And, you know, better, when Aretha's singing it. 11.57am: Supreme court justice John Paul Stevens is introduced, to administer Biden's oath of office. Biden lays his hand on the bible. The oath: ""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" And thus America has a new vice-president. Biden does a little arms-wide ""how about that then?"" gesture; Bruce Springsteen chuckles. (Bruce Springsteen's chuckle is not a consitutional requirement.) 12 noon: It's noon, so I guess that means Robert Gates is president for a few minutes? (UPDATE: No, it turns out. Bush is still president, Biden is vice-president. How weird is that? UPDATE II: Confusion reigns. Apparently it's Biden. Or maybe not.) The star-studded quartet of Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gabriela Montero and Anthony McGill are introduced. They're playing a selection of music arranged by John Williams, which lends an appropriately cinematic tenor to proceedings. (It's based around the Shaker song Simple Gifts.) 12.04pm: And here's Obama, with Chief Justice John Roberts. Obama uses his full name, of course, as protocol dictates, but it's still somewhat extraordinary to remember that America just elected someone with the middle name Hussein. He stumbles slightly over the oath, actually, though it seemed that it was Roberts who stumbled first... but they get through it. And so here we are. You can imagine the scenes on the Mall. 12.07pm: Obama takes the podium. ""Thank you, thank you... My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors."" Forty-four people have taken the oath, he says, but ""every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms... That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood"": war, economic crisis. ""And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."" 12.11pm: ""Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: they will be met."" 12.13pm: He praises ""the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things... time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions."" America is still the most prosperous nation on earth, he says, its minds no less inventive, ""our capacity... undiminished... But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions: that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."" 12.16pm: A pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place,"" and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Now he's rejecting the notion that this isn't a time for grand ambitions. ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them: the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply."" The question isn't big or small government, but whether government works; not whether the free market is good or bad but that it needs a ""watchful eye."" ""As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" 12.18pm: ""And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more..."" America will ""begin responsibly to leave Iraq to its people"" and start to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet... [but] we will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you,"" because America's ""patchwork heritage"" is a strength, not a weakness. Pretty aggressive stuff. He mentions Americans' various religions, and also ""non-believers"": a first for an inaugural address? That's impressive. 12.21pm: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West: know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."" We can no longer afford to ignore ""suffering outside our borders,"" he says. ""Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect."" And more about the international community: a real internationalist focus here, which as a non-American I can't help finding some of the most rousing stuff. (I take the commentators' point, though, that Euroliberals would probably have condemned some of Obama's words on spreading the American ideal abroad if it had been uttered by George Bush as, indeed, it was, in his 2004 inaugural...) The sense of being somewhat stressed that was evident on Obama's face a little earlier has vanished; at this podium, it seems, is where he feels most at home. 12.24pm: And now the much-anticipated passage on personal responsibility. The whole speech, indeed, is notable for how much focus Obama's putting on seeking to buck Americans up, to stiffen their spines, to call them to action. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility: a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship... This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed... and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Huge, huge applause. 12.26pm: Building to a finale now, remembering George Washington's words in the harsh winter of 1776. ""In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America."" 12.28pm: A long poem now by Elizabeth Alexander. (I'll let others dissect it later.) The civil rights leader Reverend Joseph Lowery is here to deliver the benediction. (Only a few minutes until the Bush Helicopter Moment now!) ""Mend our brokenness, heal our wounds, and delivery us from the exploitation of the poor,"" Lowery asks God. ""...We walk together, pledging that we won't get weary in the difficult days ahead."" And then a rather unexpected rhyming riff about racial diversity and co-operation, which I missed and will post here as soon as I get hold of a copy. UPDATE: Here it is. Lowery called for the day ""when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white would embrace what is right."" So there. 12.39pm: The national anthem concludes this part of the proceedings, with hundreds of thousands on the Mall joining in -- although quite a few left immediately after the swearing-in, doubtless to avoid the crush. Bush and Obama move through the crowd together now. The helicopter awaits. The crowd on the Mall: are they ecstatic? Yes, they are ecstatic. 12.47pm: Obama and ""the former president Bush"" -- there are two of them, now! -- enter the Capitol building. They'll walk through it to the east side, where Marines line the staircase and a helicopter waits in the courtyard. The helicopter is Executive One; it's only Marine One when the president is inside it. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 12.50pm: The Obamas and Bushes emerge onto the steps and pose for photographs. I've got to say, Bush looks positively glowing now that it's all over. They're exchanging what looks like small talk. (What could it be?) 12.52pm: A positively jovial mood seems to prevail between the two men as they walk towards the helicopter flanked by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. A pat on the shoulder from Obama to Bush, words between George and Michelle, and then a final handshake between 43 and 44. The helicopter's staircases swing up and closed, leaving the Obamas and the Bidens on the east Capitol steps. The helicopter rotors start turning, blowing Michelle Obama's hair. 12.56pm: And Bush goes up and away; the helicopter grows small. There is, as you might imagine, quite a bit of cheering from the crowds on the Mall. Apparently the helicopter may go on a bit of scenic tour of DC, but it's headed ultimately to Andrews Air Force Base, whereupon the Bushes will board a plane for Texas. ""Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye,"" sing the spectators on the Mall. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 2.07pm: I had a chicken sandwich. Obama ate food from Lincoln's era, although not technically one hopes. The menu is here. Pheasant, duck, sour cherry chutney and molassses sweet potatoes, followed by apple cinnamon sponge cake. 2.41pm: They're still eating; Nancy Pelosi is addressing the diners. The crowds lining the parade route remain excitable. The inaugural parade is, well, a parade. The one genuinely intriguing question is whether, when, and for how long Obama will get out of his limousine and walk for part of the route along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Carter was the first president to walk the entire route, but security concerns mean that if Obama walks it'll almost certainly be just for a small portion of it. 2.51pm: ""Medical emergency reported at Congressional luncheon,"" MSNBC reports Ted Kennedy has been taken out of the luncheon on a stretcher. Obama is speaking to the diners now, and begins his remarks with words of praise for the Massachusetts senator. UPDATE: And 91-year-old Robert Byrd, who was ""removed in his wheelchair under the supervision of medical personnel."" UPDATE II: Byrd's going to be OK, apparently, and the reports on Kennedy seem broadly upbeat, too. 3.20pm: And the parade begins. The Obamas and the Bidens, looking exceptionally cold on the Capitol steps -- Michelle looks positively exhausted -- stand for a military march-past. There are many tubas. 3.24pm: The first couple enter the Beast, the president's extraordinarily well-protected limousine, license plate USA1. Obama seems a little awkward saluting the various military personnel lining the route. The motorcade progresses at walking pace out of the Capitol grounds. 3.36pm: The limousine reaches the parade route, with tens of motorcycles, blue and red lights flashing, in the lead. The crowds lining the route -- only five or six deep at this point, because access is restricted -- whoop and scream. 4.03pm: Finally, as the motorcade reaches the Navy Memorial, the limousine slows to a halt -- not that it was going fast in the first place -- and the Obamas get out, several blocks earlier than planned, apparently. They're striding purposefully up Pennsylvania Avenue now, flanked by Secret Service personnel, waving at the onlookers. (We're running so far behind schedule now that the light is beginning to fade.) They're walking significantly faster than the car was travelling, by my reckoning. This administration can't be seen to be taking things easy. 4.11pm: And back into The Beast. 4.15pm: The motorcade approaches the White House, where the Obamas will take their positions in a heavily bulletproofed viewing stand to watch the passing parade. I'm going to wrap this up now, but if you've got access to TV coverage, you've got plenty of parading left to watch, should you so choose. What a day; what a moment to have witnessed. Thank you for reading and commenting. More post-inauguration blogging from me here tomorrow.",2009-01-20T13:56:40Z,News
7,obama,"Obama inauguration: President delivers wintry performance • Perlman, McGill, Montero and Ma play Williams arrangement• Bleak weather a recurring theme of Obama speech Pulling together a classical ensemble that might conceivably represent what Obama would call ""our patchwork heritage"" is no easy task in the white-dominated world of classical music, but it was done. Here was a perfectly politically correct chamber group to usher in the inaugural address: African-American Anthony McGill played the clarinet; French-born Chinese-American Yo-Yo Ma took the cello part; and Itzhak Perlman, born in Tel Aviv, was the violinist. At the piano was Gabriela Montero, who lives in the US, but is a celebrity in her native Venezuela. The music? Air and Simple Gifts by John Williams, the composer of a myriad film scores from Star Wars to Schindler's List. The work is based on the same humble Shaker hymn that Copland quoted in his ballet Appalachian Spring, a melody so American as to be almost a cliche. The sweet and yearning strains of Williams's piece was an apt introduction to the president's address. As a performer, Obama has in the past done rousing and energetically inspiring; he has kicked back and become the cheery anecdotalist and joker. But even in his speech on race relations in Philadelphia this March, he did not take a tone so sombre and sober as to compare with the almost funereal delivery of his inaugural speech. The president barely smiled - he had kept his expression darkly checked as he emerged into the light of the Capitol steps – and his deep seriousness was somewhat at odds with the flamboyance of the costume department, which had tricked out the women of his family in a rainbow of pink and orange, of fuchsia and blue, and of glimmering lime. Obama's performance was more suitably matched with George Bush's costume of the day – a black overcoat mournfully matched with a black scarf. The most striking recurring imagery of the speech – which was always going to be a finely wrought literary creation – was of bleak weather. Obama talked of ""gathering clouds and raging storms"", of ""icy currents"", of ""snow stained with blood"", and used a near-Shakespeare quote, ""winter of our hardship"". His delivery was wintry, too – there was none of the rabble-rousing, preacher-man effervescence that he can summon up on occasion. Nor, significantly, did he spill out lines (such as his famous ""Yes we can"") that demanded an audience's vocal response; or deal in self-consciously memorable soundbites (there was no equivalent here of Kennedy's ""ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country""). It was time to set aside childish things, he said, and this was a grown-up piece of speaking, consciously recalling Roosevelt's inaugural address, and designed to apotheosise him from folksy people's friend to tough leader of men – and the delivery of which was at its most animated and arresting when he promised America's enemies: ""You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."" In short, a performance virtuosic in its magisterial gloom.",2009-01-20T19:11:29Z,News
8,obama,"Obama inauguration: Themes of the inaugural address • Renunciation of George Bush key to Barack Obama's address• Speech touches on environment and end to plutocracy Renunciation of the Bush era Nowhere was Barack Obama's inaugural address more outspoken or heartfelt than in the condemnation of the presidency that had come to an end moments earlier. The Bush epoque was ""our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions"". He presented it as a detour from America's destiny, and he repeatedly invoked the need to return to American ideals stretching back to the country's most celebrated founding father and first president, George Washington. In other words, as Obama has said before, it was time for America to reboot. Early in the speech, he briskly ran through a catalogue of failure: ""Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many"" while America's energy policies, ""strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet"". In a withering farewell to the age, he quoted Corinthians - ""the time has come to set aside childish things"". A ""new era of responsibility"" and an end to plutocracy To put an end to this age of fecklessness, Obama's emphasis was on the need for shared sacrifice. It was intended as a counterpoint to one of the most criticised aspects of the Bush presidency - that it called for huge sacrifices from the nation's servicemen, but not from its civilians and especially not for its rich, who benefited from extraordinary tax cuts. Obama warned that Americans would have to recognise ""that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world."" In place of ""those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame"" - the people Bush once jokingly referred to as ""his base"" - the new president looked for inspiration to the unknown Americans ""obscure in their labour"", who had fought and worked ""till their hands were raw"". Noting that ""a nation cannot prosper long when it favours only the prosperous"", Obama in effect called for an end to plutocracy. It was as close to class rhetoric as an American president ever comes. A green new deal In an echo of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural, Obama said it was not the nation that had failed. The crisis was a consequence of failure of leadership, and the ""greed and irresponsibility"" of a few. The answer was to get back to work, with the government in the lead. It was a 21st Century version of FDR's New Deal, with a pledge that when the country rebuilt, it would rebuild in a sustainable way. ""We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together,"" Obama said. ""We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Science would be ""restored to its rightful place. A return to soft power One of the few times the rhythm of the speech was broken by spontaneous applause was when Obama rejected what he portrayed as a false choice ""between our safety and our ideals"". The short phrase encapsulated a deep-seated unease that, in striking out against its enemies, America had lost its way, stumbled into Guantanamo Bay and ""black"" CIA detention sites, and abdicated its claim to moral leadership. Obama promised the rest of the world ""we are ready to lead once more"". What had won previous great struggles had been ""sturdy alliances and enduring convictions"" not ""power alone"". Americans could not ""do as we please"", but had to rely more on soft power - ""the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humilty and restraint"", and addressing the Muslim world in particular, he offered a ""new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect"". Pragmatism above all Time and again, Obama made clear his intention was not to lurch from one deeply ideological administration to another. Pragmatism would the watchword in the White House. Government programs would be pursued when they worked, axed when they did not. Market forces were neither good nor bad. They could generate wealth but had to be kept under a ""watchful eye"". Similarly foreign policy would be geared to the realities of the outside world. Even despots could be forgiven, knowing that America ""will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist"".",2009-01-20T19:42:06Z,News
9,obama,"Obama women give inauguration ensembles modern twist Orange and pink is the new red, white and blue Michelle Obama got dressed today knowing that every thread of the outfit she picked for the moment she became first lady would be forensically inspected for meaning. Her choice was a dress and coat in Swiss wool lace, lined in French silk, designed by a Cuban-American fashion designer, Isabel Toledo, and made by a team of Chinese, Polish and Spanish seamstresses in Toledo's New York studio. As the images were beamed around the world, the colour was being described by many commentators as gold, with all the regal connotations of that colour; the New York Times, however, judged it to be the rather more subtle and sophisticated shade of lemon grass. Toledo herself, who only knew for sure that her outfit had made the cut when she saw it on CNN today, described it as an ""optimistic"" colour, that ""had sunshine"". The bold choices that characterised her campaign wardrobe made Michelle Obama a fashion icon even before the election. Today was her first attempt to blend her own, very modern image with the venerated position of first lady. Stung, perhaps, by the lukewarm reception to the daring black-and-red dress she wore on election night (one wit described that as ""an apron designed by Mark Rothko"") she seemed to lean a little too heavily on recent precedent today. In her richly textured lace, and abiding by a now old-fashioned convention of a matching dress and coat, Obama appeared to be ""channelling"" the stately look favoured by Barbara and Laura Bush on state occasions, rather than the sleek, pared down image of Jackie Kennedy, to whom she has often been compared. What lifted the outfit were the accessories: sleek leather gloves (which she used to hold the Bible during her husband's swearing in) and Jimmy Choo pumps in a smartly offbeat shade of olive. From a fashion-watcher's perspective, it was Malia and Sasha Obama who stole the show today. Not even Aretha Franklin's spectacular hat could compete with a virtuoso display of on-trend colour-blocking by the first daughters, in their contrasting coats and scarves. Malia, 10, looked terrific in electric blue and black while Sasha, 7, hit it out of the park in this season's hot orange-and-pink colour combination. You heard it here first: orange and pink is the new red, white and blue.",2009-01-20T19:05:11Z,News
10,obama,"President Obama calls for remaking of America Millions brave freezing temperatures in Washington for historic inauguration ceremony Barack Obama, the first African-American to be elected to the White House, today called for a ""new era of responsibility"" as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States. In front of a crowd of more than 1 million people, Obama acknowledged in his inauguration speech that times were fraught, with the US fighting two wars and grappling with the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. ""That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood,"" he told a crowd that stretched out for miles before him. ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. ""Our economy is badly weakened – a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age."" But the 47-year-old said he was ready to meet the challenges confronting the US: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."" Obama went on to say that the US ""will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan"". While not mentioning al-Qaida by name, he had hard words for America's enemies. ""We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence,"" the new US president said. ""And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."" In an indictment of the Bush era, he also called for a return to traditional values of hard work and honesty. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility – a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world ..."" The handover to a new US administration began its ritual unfolding when Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived at the White House to be met by George and Laura Bush on a red carpet. The four posed for the cameras after Michelle, wearing a pale gold sheath dress with matching coat by the Cuban-born American designer Isabel Toledo, handed a giftwrapped box to the Bushes. After the traditional short pre-inauguation coffee, the incoming and outgoing presidential entourages made their way in their armoured motorcades to the ceremony. The soul music legend Aretha Franklin kicked off proceedings by singing Let Freedom Ring, watched by the Washington elite and Hollywood celebrities including Dustin Hoffman, Stephen Spielberg and John Cusack. As Bush arrived at the Capitol, a smattering of boos could be heard. Dick Cheney, Bush's vice-president, who had pulled a muscle in his back, attended the ceremony in a wheelchair. Bush later left the White House by helicopter for the last time. In keeping with tradition, Bush had left a note for Obama in the top drawer of his desk in the Oval Office. Dana Perino, the former White House press secretary, said it wished Obama well in beginning a ""fabulous new chapter"" in the US. Planners expected attendance easily to top the 1.2 million people who attended Lyndon Johnson's 1965 inauguration, the largest crowd the national park service has on record. Trains were crowded, and passengers were in jubilant and expectant mood, despite the early hour and subzero temperatures. Thousands of charter buses from across the country are in the capital, packing car parks and streets, many of which closed last night to accommodate the surge of overnight visitors and day-trippers. For the great gathering, Washington was locked down, with street closures, checkpoints, camouflage-clad soldiers at main intersections, air patrols and police boats in the harbour. As the crowds packed into the US Capitol grounds and nearby parkland to witness Obama take the oath of office, as many as 40,000 military, civilian and private security officers were on duty, roughly one for every 50 people in attendance. Just before Obama was sworn in, the homeland security department said it was investigating a potential threat ""of uncertain credibility"". Law enforcement and intelligence officials said they had received information that people associated with a Somalia-based group, al-Shabaab, may try to travel to the US with plans to disrupt the inauguration. Obama took his oath on the same Bible Abraham Lincoln used at his 1861 inauguration, when he proclaimed the end of slavery. Tomorrow, on his first working day in office, Obama is expected to fulfil his campaign promise to begin the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq under a 16-month timetable. Aides said he would summon the joint chiefs of staff to the Oval Office to order the pullout. Before the inauguration, the Vatican released a message from Pope Benedict XVI in which the Pontiff said he was praying that God would grant Obama ""unfailing wisdom and strength"" in carrying out his responsibilities. Benedict also said attention must be paid to the poor, the outcast, the hungry and ""those who have no voice"".",2009-01-20T18:07:00Z,News

""This gives me strength. We have waited so long. God is good, God is good, God is good."" As Bob Marley's One Love began to play, Ruth Odaga said she had been ""touched in a very special way"". ""Last January we were fighting here"" – the town of Kisumu was badly hit in Kenya's post-election violence – ""and now look at the happiness Obama has given everyone,"" she said. Celebrations were already in full swing across the country that includes ""the small village where my father was born"" that Obama referred to in his speech. In nearby Kogelo, where Obama Sr grew up, the party was at Barack Obama primary school, where classrooms had become makeshift hotels with names like Something Cold and Connie of Siaya.

George Otieno, 19, and in his final year of study at the adjacent secondary school, said: ""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said.

16,obama,"President Obama hails new 'Age of Responsibility' President Obama pledges to 'roll back the spectre of a warming planet' by changing the way America uses energy and the world's resources President Barack Obama, in his inaugural address to the packed crowds on the National Mall in Washington DC, told his rapt audience that America needed a ""new era of responsibility"" to deal with both the financial and environmental crises his new administration faced. After a stammering through the oath of office, the subtext of the gritty speech was that it would be hard – very hard – but America had the resourcefulness to reinvent itself. The new president's commitment to his environmental agenda shone through the dour images of a world economy in crisis with references to ""rolling back"" global warming through transforming the way America uses energy by harnessing ""the sun and the wind and the soil"". ""My fellow citizens. I stand here today humbled by the task before us,"" he said, ""Every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms."" Those storms are the metaphorical tempests on the global markets, but they are also the gales that will literally result from climate instability caused by rising CO2 emissions. Obama hinted that the Bush administration's championing of fossil fuels had created grave problems – both climatic and geopolitical. ""The ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and endanger our planet,"" he said, referring presumably to Middle Eastern oil. But ultimately, his message was one of hope. The challenges the country faces will are not insurmountable, he said. ""Know this America, they will be met,"" he said, ""On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear."" ""We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth… Our capacity remains undiminished,"" he added. Today was not a day for detailed solutions to the climate change threat or for a policy-wonk's guide to the new green economy that Obama promised on the campaign trail. That hard graft begins later. But there was a statement of intent that scientific and environmental issues would occupy a renewed place in the Oval Office. ""We will restore science to its rightful place,"" he said, ""We will harness the sun and the wind and the soil to fuel our cars."" Before the inaugaration, Obama had already delighted scientists and environmentalists with his choice of green-minded scientists that will join his administration and his professed attitude to scientific evidence. He has emphasised the need to listen to scientists, ""especially when it is inconvenient"". In a signal of this renewed respect for evidence he has restored the authority of the president's science advisor to the White House. Obama's pick for the position, John Holdren, professor of environmental policy at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has been uncompromising in his warnings about the threat posed by climate change (he dislikes the phrase ""global warming"" because it he says oversimplifies the nature of the problem). The new president has invited Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University to become head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the government agency that studies the climate and monitors the health of marine ecosystems. She has been a powerful advocate for action on climate change. Obama has also received plaudits for his pick of Nobel prizewinning physicist Steven Chu for energy secretary. During the campaign, Obama committed himself to a $150bn investment over the next decade in green energy. He wants to put 1m plug-in hybrid cars, with a fuel consumption of 150 miles per gallon, on the road by 2015. He also pledged that 10% of US electricity supplies should come from renewable sources by 2012 and 25% by 2025. He also signalled an intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. He will be under pressure to make good on these commitments and quickly. In his closing statements, President Obama pledged to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet"". But his message was even more fundamental than just changing the way the US and world uses energy. ""We can no longer afford indifference to the suffering that occurs outside our borders. Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to the effect,"" he said. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility… This is the price and promise of citizenship."" It remains to be seen whether ordinary Americans are prepared to take that responsibility and make the sacrifices their new leader is asking for.",2009-01-20T17:36:44Z,News
17,obama,"President Obama attacks 'failure' of Bush era New president invokes spirit of America's founding citizens in inauguration speech to Washington crowds A passionate and determined Barack Obama used his inaugural address as the 44th president of the United States to deliver a stinging indictment of George Bush's eight years in power. In front of an estimated 1 million people outside the US Capitol and billions more watching around the world on television, the new president attacked a period of ""greed and irresponsibility"" and ""our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age"". There had been ""a sapping of confidence across our land, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable"", Obama said. As his predecessor looked on, hunched in his overcoat, Obama quoted scripture to herald a new era of maturity in Washington. ""The time has come to set aside childish things,"" he said. It was as though he wanted to reboot American politics by taking it back to the principles set by the father of the nation, the first president, George Washington. Obama proclaimed ""an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics"". Using an often epic sweep of reference ranging from Christian scripture to America's frontier history he reaffirmed his country's ""greatness"" and mapped out his ambition to get America back on course, which, he reminded his audience, was set by Washington fighting on the banks of the Potomac river during the war of independence. The president said America remained the ""most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth"" but added that ""our time of ... protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely passed"". In a metaphor that suggested America had been somehow knocked to the floor under the Bush administration, he said that ""starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America"". Obama raised the prospect of a new American era of hard work and determination, and early in his speech he invited the audience to remember the spirit of America's founding citizens, ""who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and travelled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west, endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth. ""We understand that greatness is never a given,"" he said, advocating a new era of humility in apparent contrast to the previous administration. ""It must be earned."" On foreign policy he promised a predictable hard line against terrorists and ""those who slaughter innocents"", warning in powerful tones that ""our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you"".But there was little to be gleaned about his strategy on Iraq and Afghanistan, which he dealt with in a single sentence: ""We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan."" This prompted more questions than answers about his policy on Afghanistan in particular. Did this mean he would press for a rapid end to hostilities or was he preparing for engagement lasting for years to come? He promised to ""seek a new way forward"" with Muslim countries ""based on mutual interest and mutual respect"" but said little else about one of the largest geopolitical fault lines he must negotiate in his presidency. There was, however, a determined effort to rebrand America as a multicultural and multi-faith nation after the Bush administration's focus on Christianity, which was backed by a pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place"", and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories"", one of several mentions of his green ambitions. Obama heralded the strength of his country's ""patchwork heritage"" – of which his own Kenyan/American ancestry is a good example. ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus"" as well as ""non-believers"", perhaps the first time this group has been mentioned in an inaugural address. Aid agencies around the world will have been pleased to hear him tell the other rich nations that ""we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders"". To the people of poor nations, he said: ""We pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.""",2009-01-20T17:36:00Z,News

Three young campaigners were killed in 1964 in events that were later enshrined in the film Mississippi Burning. Young watched Obama's speech at a local prison where he is a corrections officer. For him it was simply ""the most significant event I have seen in my lifetime"". The profound nature of the day for Young was not just about a black person like himself being declared president. ""He had an inclusive message for everyone in our nation – that we can do anything when we pull together and are no longer separated by colour and ideals."" As a boy Young lived through the segregation of schools in Philadelphia and threats from the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. He feels that the deep south still has a long way to go before rooting out discrimination, as it is ""so ingrained in our society over the years"". But he believes Obama's speech will have reached even Mississippi. ""He stirred up our hopes and invoked the constitution – telling us that we are all involved, we are all part of this country, and we should take our rightful place"". Peter Silver Silver watched the inauguration on a wide screen at the Harlem offices of the Reverend Al Sharpton where he works. He was in awe of the feat of oratory that Obama pulled off, but also affected more personally. ""I have inter-racial children and it was encouraging to me to hear him say that race, yes, does matter, but as a cultural component not an economic wall. It was like a celebration for my children, who now have a phenomenal role model, and my family and for me."" For Silver, the new president hit just the right note for the commander-in-chief and economist-in-chief at a time of such anxiety on both fronts. There was also a poignant moment for him relating to the former president George Bush. Obama was speaking about the need to reach out throughout the world to those who are willing rather than merely waging war, and at just that point the camera panned to Bush sitting on the side. ""He almost seemed a little bit shrunken, as if the past eight years had aged him. I have to admit, I felt a bit of remorse. The way I see it, Bush tried to do the best he could, he just wasn't the right person for the job.""",2009-01-20T18:41:50Z,News
19,obama,"Obama inauguration: 'He promised a new American revolution' In their own words: political bloggers analyse the new US president's inaugural address Alex Koppelman, Salon The new president's speech was lofty in its language, but its subject was, in some sense, as earthy as it gets. What Barack Obama said today was that the story of American freedom is social history – the stuff of ordinary people's lives. The gist of Obama's argument during the campaign was that the trouble with our politics was that it had nothing to do with what was actually happening in people's lives. Struggles in cities and towns around the country seemed to have nothing to do with action in Washington, as if it were another country's capital. David Frum, New Majority One thing to learn from that speech – Obama is adjusting to his new role. He has learned that he must delegate even his own writing, which cannot have been easy. I feel sure that speech was not the personal work of this highly eloquent man. It takes a team of highly trained professionals to produce something quite so flat! it seems to evoke every oft-expressed thought and repeat so many well-worn phrases. Andrew Sullivan, The Daily Dish Emotionally, it spoke for itself. I cannot deny there are tears in my eyes. Intellectually, this struck me as the core point: ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them – that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works. The ability to put behind the ideologies of the recent past in order to regain the values of American history is the core message, it seems to me. He was arguing that we need to think again, to put aside childish things, and that this is the mark of responsibility and adulthood. Jacob Heilbrunn, Huffington Post He promised a new American revolution. His evocation of George Washington at the end of his address made it clear that he regards the perils that face the country as almost no less daunting than those that it confronted in battling for its independence. Obama's inaugural address, sober and dignified, has set the foundation for constructing a new gleaming edifice of democracy. It is up to us as much as Obama to construct it. Roger Simon, Politico He looked very serious, almost sombre, throughout his inaugural ceremony. And as he has done repeatedly in the last few weeks, he listed the barriers America faces, the mountains we have yet to climb. Will any of these words someday be carved in marble? That depends not on the words, but on the presidency. Nobody remembers the words of failed administrations. Robert Kaiser, Washington Post A memorable inaugural address. There haven't been many in my experience. Obama clearly wrote this one, as any reader of his books could immediately attest. I was also struck by the shots he took at Bush, with the outgoing president sitting right there. Think how Bush heard this line: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.""",2009-01-20T19:27:51Z,News

This gave the thousands of Iranians who were watching the inauguration ceremony via their illegal satellite dishes a glimmer of hope that three decades of Iran-US hostility might be about to end. Hamed Mohaghegh, 21, an industrial civil engineering student in Tehran, watching the ceremony on BBC, said that the US had given its democracy a boost by electing an black man as president,. ""Before Obama was elected, we had this impression in our country that a black man will never succeed to become the president of the States, a candidate who had an Arabic middle name, Hussein."" ""Ahmadinejad has also doubted - saying that he thinks that [American voters would] not let a black man become the president of the US,"" said Reza Ahmadi, 40, an Iranian math teacher at high school.

Media Kashigar, 52, a well-known Iranian intellectual and critic believes that the US foreign policy has not changed at least in the past 30 years toward Iran.

The auditorium was so full the security guards had to keep people who were sitting on the stairs moving. There wasn't much more room in the balcony, where people were standing at least two deep. The anticipation built throughout the afternoon, with the cheers getting louder each time Obama was pictured on the screen. Earlier on, actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah got a huge cheer as he told how, once Obama had secured the Democratic nomination, he had tried to put all thoughts of inauguration to one side for fear that the day would never come. So too did African-American playwright Bonnie Greer when she faltered slightly, holding back the emotion at the thought of what she was about to witness. ""I have to go home to talk to my mama,"" said Greer, who is from the same area of Chicago as Michelle Obama. ""Not since Nelson Mandela has anything felt so much like liberation.

23,obama,"Obama inauguration: Let the remaking of America begin today  Barack Hussein Obama was today sworn in as 44th president of the United States of America in front of quite possibly the largest mass of humanity ever to have gathered in one place for a single political moment. As many as 2 million people in Washington's National Mall heard their new commander-in-chief deliver a sombre 20-minute speech in which he acknowledged that the country was in the midst of crisis – mired in wars, its economy struggling and its national confidence sapped. He promised the largely silent crowd that the challenges would be met, but warned it would take time, some sacrifice, a new form of politics and a re-engagement with the world, in which America would recognise that ""power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please"". President Obama took the oath just after midday under a crisp and cloudless azure sky in front of the glistening cream dome of the Capitol, which, it is now accepted, was partly built by slaves. The day, cold enough to freeze breath, had begun with millions of individual journeys by coach, train and on foot as the crowds began converging before dawn for a moment widely taken as one of renewal and of double foreclosure. This was to be the end of the last eight years of Republican rule and of the bars which, at any previous time in history, would have made the election of an African American president unthinkable. They had come to celebrate – and for days they had been doing just that in parties and balls all over town. The cheer as Obama swore his oath on Lincoln's Bible rippled and roared all the way from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol, nearly two miles away. But when Obama spoke it was immediately apparent that the tone of this inauguration was grave, addressed as much to the hundreds of millions tuned in around the world as to the shimmering sea of upturned faces in front of him. ""That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood,"" he said. ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. ""Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."" If this was read as a repudiation of the previous eight years of Bush, there was plenty more of it. There was, said Obama, a nagging fear that American decline was inevitable; he wanted an end to ""petty grievances and false promises""; the time had passed for ""protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions""; a nation could not prosper long ""when it favours only the prosperous"". In one of the few lines to be greeted by fervent applause, he turned to defence, proclaiming ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals"". In a thinly-veiled reference to Guantánamo and torture he promised not to abandon the rule of law and human rights ""for expedience's sake"". There was further implicit criticism of his predecessor's policies in his comments on science and the environment. He vowed to ""restore science to its rightful place"" and made several references to climate change, acknowledging the threat to our planet and saying America would in future ""harness the sun and the winds and the soil"" for energy. On international affairs, he singled out the Muslim world, offering ""a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. America would leave Iraq ""to its people"" and forge a ""hard-earned peace"" in Afghanistan. All inauguration ceremonies consciously celebrate, and reference, both the constitution and former presidents. Four ghosts hovered over yesterday's ceremony. Lincoln's Gettysburg address gave the new president the overarching theme for his speech – the ""new birth of freedom"". It is Lincoln, the gangly lawyer from Illinois, who has fascinated Obama more than any other previous president. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves and yesterday's inauguration were in some ways bookends to the darkest stain on America's history. For many in the crowd this was the over-riding reason for the pilgrimage to Washington. Obama put it simply: ""A man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" The second ghost was Martin Luther King, who, had he lived, would have been an 80-year-old spectator. No one in the crowd could have been oblivious to the echo across time of the words that had rung out from the other end of the National Mall 45 years previously. And then there were JFK and FDR. Obama's call for responsibility and sacrifice recalled both Kennedy in 1961 and Roosevelt's heartfelt cry in 1933: ""We now realise as we have never realised before our interdependence on each other."" Obama's serious tone and his unflinching acknowledgement of the economic hurricane blowing through America echoed Roosevelt's speech at the time of the last serious global depression, in which an incoming president vowed ""to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly … with a candour … which the present situation of our nation impels"". The endless crowd listened solemnly to the same sentiments today. They might have come wishing for something more uplifting, but, for many, the day reached beyond symbolism to a moment of genuine transformation after which nothing could be the same again. As Obama headed back into the Capitol building at the end of the ceremony clouds began rolling over what had until then been a pure blue sky. But there was one final, rousing cheer as the helicopter carrying George W Bush rose over the gleaming dome of government and took the former president off to Texas – and out of public life for ever.",2009-01-20T21:42:56Z,News

But for the 13 locals who set off from a hospital car park on Monday night for Barack Obama's inauguration, this was no ordinary trip. They left the country to camp in the city. Braced for maximum discomfort they wore heavy boots, rucksacks, several layers, sleeping bags and blankets. They came to sleep on the floor, inch through the crowds and stand in the cold. They came to be part of something bigger than themselves. They came for history. And they got what they came for. ""Just to be there and be part of that energy will be great,"" said Sarah Goodman, as she baked cookies during the day. ""It's like being part of the grand finale of this hard work and I just have to be there."" Marjorie Joyce wanted to extend the giddy feeling of election night for as long as possible. ""It's a continuation of everything we worked for during the election and the excitement that I felt on election night,"" she said. ""When everyone was united in believing that America was about everyone pulling together. I was wanting to feel that in person and be among the people."" With a few exceptions, they spoke of Obama's inauguration as though it were an inevitable fact of life - the logical consequence of the American people surveying the choices and picking the best. But when I arrived in Roanoke five weeks before the election, the mood was anything but bold. Obama supporters discussed their allegiance in hushed tones. Some in a nearby town asked one campaigner not to reveal their support for fearthey might be ostracised. They had come a long way since those dog days of September: on election day Virginia went Democratic for the first time in more than 40 years. And now they just had a little bit further to go - 250 miles and a four-hour drive. We hadn't even left Roanoke when the road signs warned of traffic delays for the inauguration. But the mood remained bright. Sarah passed around her cookies and Marjorie wanted to take bets on what Michelle Obama would be wearing. Brian thought purple; Marjorie guessed red. The traffic was clear shortly after midnight as we drove into Washington. Before we could roll out our sleeping bags and bed down for the night Terri wanted to brief us for the day ahead. Holding up a map she guided us through the next day with a few useful pointers. Bring toilet paper - there may be 5,000 Portapotties lining the Mall but apparently few of them were stocked. Look out for the JumboTrons, the giant screens punctuating the Mall that made it feel like you were both watching the event on television and that you were there. And stay warm. The forecast was for snow in the evening and harsh cold in the morning. We woke at about six today with sleep in our eyes and hope in the air. Outside a trickle of visitors passed the house at dawn, soon turning into a stream and within an hour a flood. As 10 of us set off our strides were reduced to baby steps by the crowd. They'd come for a ringside seat on history, but at that moment it wasn't clear whether we would find a seat or even get to see the ring. We spent the next 90 minutes nudging our way forward step by step, sometimes following people who were themselves lost. We found our own piece of Promised Land by the Washington monument, surrounded by flags and with a good view of a JumboTron. Like a lost tribe by that stage, we were down to just three - the rest abandoned on corners unknown. As Obama raised his hand Terri said she never thought she would see the day. A tear fell from below her glasses. Her bold assertion of a holiday booked a year in advance gave way to the reality of making that dream come true in relatively conservative Roanoke. ""This is not something I thought I would live to see in my lifetime. A black man becoming president ... It's been a pretty amazing journey.""",2009-01-20T21:13:18Z,News
25,obama,"Obama inauguration: John F Kennedy's speechwriter hails Obama's address Kennedy's principal speechwriter - who wrote the January 1961 inaugural address which included the lines: ""Ask not what your country can do for you…"" - on President Obama's inaugural speech Today was a very emotional day for me. Of course it brought back very powerful memories of January 1961, but I have been a strong supporter of Obama since the day he declared his intention to run. My friends told me that I was crazy, that he had no chance, a liberal Democrat and a black man. So yes, it was emotional to watch him take the oath of office. It was a great day, and the speech and its contents symbolise the greatness of the day, and the change that this country is embarking upon, now that the eight years of the previous administration are over at last. In terms of delivery it was excellent, very forceful and very well paced, and his sincerity and commitment came through. But there were parts of the speech in which he made it clear that he had compassion for those who had suffered from the economic collapse, just as there were parts of the speech where he made it clear that the reliance solely on military power, which he said cannot alone protect us, that those days are over. Parts were certainly downbeat, and in terms of speech psychology there are probably those who would have advised him otherwise. Nevertheless, each time he followed with upbeat statements that we were going to overcome those challenges. That we had a strong economy, and a productive workforce. Taken as a whole, it struck a very hopeful note. I thought as a whole it was a very thoughtful speech. It invoked our ancestors and the struggles they went through to keep freedom alive, and I thought that that was very appropriate at this time. The conclusion in particular was very strong, which made reference to the earliest struggles for independence and liberty, when Britain was the oppressor. And I have to assume that it will be hailed overseas. My experience is that great speeches are frequently in the eye of the beholder: Obama is so respected, even beloved, around the world that I think the speech will be hailed. I have been speaking for two years of the parallels between Obama and Kennedy: two young senators, Kennedy even younger than Obama, two men committed to peace. Two men with progressive domestic policies and a multilateral foreign policy. Two men who reached out to young people and brought them into the campaign, and now, in Obama's case, bringing them into government. President Kennedy, I am sure, would be beside himself with joy at today's events, having turned our country around in its attitudes towards our black citizens, with his speech to the nation, and then his legislation to Congress in June 1963. The very idea of a black man being elected president, when in those days blacks could not be elected to almost any office, including the House of Representatives; he would think it was a wonderful day for America.",2009-01-20T19:28:57Z,News
26,obama,"Obama brings new voice of hope, Nelson Mandela says In a letter to new US president, former South African leader describes Obama's election as 'something truly historic' Fifteen years after the world celebrated the election of a black president that many doubted would ever happen, Nelson Mandela has written to Barack Obama comparing his inauguration to the inspiration provided by South Africa's embrace of democracy. In a letter delivered to Obama before the ceremony, the former South African president described the election of America's first black president as ""something truly historic not only in the political annals of your great nation, the United States of America, but of the world"". ""We are in some ways reminded today of the excitement and enthusiasm in our own country at the time of our transition to democracy,"" Mandela said in the letter. ""People, not only in our country but around the world, were inspired to believe that through common human effort injustice can be overcome and that together a better life for all can be achieved."" Mandela told Obama he represents a ""new voice of hope"" in a world still beset by inequality and division. ""Your election to this high office has inspired people as few other events in recent times have done. Amidst all of the human progress made over the last century the world in which we live remains one of great divisions, conflict, inequality, poverty and injustice,"" said Mandela. ""You, Mister President, have brought a new voice of hope that these problems can be addressed and that we can in fact change the world and make of it a better place."" Mandela also reminded Obama of his Kenyan origins, although even today in South Africa the new US president would commonly be regarded as ""coloured"" or mixed race, and not black. ""There is a special excitement on our continent today, Mister President, in the knowledge that you have such strong personal ties with Africa. We share in that excitement and pride,"" he said.",2009-01-20T18:47:34Z,News
27,obama,"Obama inauguration: How the presidency will be handed over  The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 23 January 2009 The Bush family did not return to the White House following Barack Obama's inauguration as president. They left Washington DC in a helicopter directly from Capitol Hill, the site of the ceremony. At 12.01pm today, special agent Donald White will take a few small steps that will mark a giant leap for his country. The secret service officer will move away from George Bush and stand behind President Obama, marking the transition of his protection to a new presidency. The by-now former president Bush will then return to the White House, and with his family take off in Marine One from the south lawn for the last time. The helicopter will take them to Andrews air force base, where they will be joined by Dick Cheney and his family, and a select group of friends. Finally, the Bushes will fly in Air Force One - though it will not be called that, because the name applies only when it is ferrying the serving president - to Midland, Texas; and thence to a new home in a suburb of Dallas, and a new life. Leaving the White House after eight years will be a poignant moment for the Bushes. At least they will be spared the callously quick handover of British prime ministers, with the humiliating exchange of removal vans on the day after the election. The only piece of furniture said to be going with them is a chest of drawers belonging to George Bush's grandmother, a contrast from 19th-century presidents who used to take everything with them. Bush administration staff have handed in their security passes, BlackBerrys and phones and coded lapel pins. Only the chief of staff, Josh Bolten, and a couple of other senior officials remain on duty. For a couple of hours, the White House will be empty of all but its permanent domestic staff. William Seale, a White House historian, recalls being in the building at that time. ""It's a wonderfully still time, with no political people around. Everything is waiting."" After lunch the Obamas will arrive. Their removal trucks will precede them, lining up on the south drive. For the first time, a black first family will enter the White House and a new era will begin.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
28,obama,"Obama inauguration: Great pilgrimage to witness 'crazy exciting' day  Gonzalez had minimal expectations when he signed up for a ticket on his senator's website, figuring they would go to the lucky or well-connected. He was neither - until 22 December when his number came up. ""Getting this ticket was exactly like winning the lottery,"" Gonzalez said. ""I've never won anything before."" Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans who will witness the final stage of Obama's journey down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, Gonzalez's trip to Washington is, in its own way, as improbable as the president's. Gonzalez knew no one in Washington, and could barely afford the air fare let alone the inflated rates of hotel rooms in inauguration week. He had to spend 10 hours a day preparing a lesson plan for the teacher who would take over his classes at a school in a poor area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. But yesterday saw Gonzalez and his partner, Phelosha Collaros, wheeling their luggage through a congressional office building, just east of the spot where Barack Obama will take the oath, inauguration tickets in hand. Collaros videoed every step of their journey for a short course Gonzalez will teach on his return. ""My students are way way out in New Mexico,"" he said. ""Most of them will never get a chance to come to Washington in their lives, so I feel a duty to bring something back to them."" A few blocks west, beneath the steps of the Capitol, Ekilah Poles, in orange gloves and furry hat, posed with her friends for photographs in front of a huge screen reading: ""44th president"". Poles reckoned yesterday was her best chance to see what Obama will see when he takes the oath on the steps of a Capitol draped with flags. She drove eight hours from Columbia, South Carolina to be in Washington, but does not have a ticket to the ceremony. ""I will be with my brethren on the mall,"" she said. Poles realises that Obama comes to office lumbered with expectations. But all she really wants is for him to connect with ordinary Americans. ""He is not going to be able to work miracles, but I expect him to tell us what hardships we are facing, and how he is going to get us through,"" she said. ""We don't necessarily have to agree."" Tim Andersen and Irina Kushner, lawyers who live in the Virginia suburbs, hurried along through the first flakes of snow. They wanted their view of history in advance. ""It's going to be too hectic dealing with everything and the road closures,"" said Andersen. Others could scarcely stay away, like the six students in Washington for just 10 days before leaving on an exchange programme to Tanzania, who congregated in front of the FBI headquarters, about halfway along Obama's route today. ""This is crazy exciting,"" said Claire Richard, a student from Oklahoma. ""It's really touched people. My grandmother who is 96 is so jazzed."" Phil and Tracie Davis, bankers from Charlotte, North Carolina, were on a dry run with their daughter, Ariel, three. ""We just want to get a sense of how she is going to do in the crowds,"" said Tracie. The couple had paid over the odds for a hotel room near the parade route, but did not manage to find tickets to the inauguration. No matter. ""We just came to soak it all in and so she will have a story to tell her grandchildren."" For guests with the means to secure a room at the luxury Willard hotel, the atmosphere will come to them. It is a mere two blocks from the White House and offers a prime view of the parade route. Anna Oginsky, who is from Michigan, booked rooms for her husband and three young children and her mother last October, even before Obama was elected. ""I just knew it was going to happen,"" she said. That sense of anticipation was building as the day wore on, and further west along Pennsylvania Avenue to No 1600, the address of the White House, the viewing stand, with its blue presidential seal and Plexiglass windows, where Obama will watch the parade in his honour, is complete. The stands for dignitaries have gone up. A few reminders of the George Bush era remain - such as the protester shrouded in black with a sign reading: ""You boys sure know how to throw a bloodbath."" But by noon today, when Obama officially takes over as president, all that will be swept away. So too will Charlene Andrews's feeling of indifference towards the city where she was born and raised. For the first time, Andrews, 40, intends to see an inauguration with her own eyes, and to take her son, Caleb, nine. The cafeteria of her workplace, a federal courthouse, has a magnificent view of the Capitol. ""I never felt a connection before,"" she said. ""I guess we take our city for granted, the fact that all this is around us."" Today that changes for the Andrews. ""This is so exciting,"" she said. ""I'm overwhelmed.""",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
29,obama,"All the conservative trappings freed Obama to frame a radical message The inauguration was brimming with tradition – just the platform for a president who could be truly transformational The ritual performed today on the steps of the US Capitol honoured tradition in every particular – even if America's new president stumbled over the time-honoured form of words that was his oath of office. Americans, lacking a monarchy, attach a near-sacred reverence to the inauguration that serves as a kind of coronation: its precise order of ceremonies, its protocols. And Obama did nothing to challenge that today. True, Aretha Franklin sang My country 'tis of thee, and Yitzhak Perlman led a distinctly modern arrangement by film composer John Williams. But otherwise, this was an exercise in tradition. Yet Obama delivered a message that was anything but conservative, offering a thorough rebuttal of his predecessor's foreign policy and signalling a break in the nearly 30-year grip the notion of limited government has exerted on US politics. Taken together, what that brief spell under the blue winter skies of Washington DC suggested was an approach that may come to characterise the Obama presidency. It is conservative in style, radical in substance. So note the exclusive presence of Protestant clergy in today's proceedings, despite the celebration of inclusivity that Obama's inauguration symbolised for so many. What's more, the invocation was given by Rev Rick Warren, a powerful evangelist who maintains a hard line against abortion, and backed last year's California campaign to outlaw gay marriage. That choice outraged many on the left – among them those in the crowds who booed when Warren took the podium today – but it reassured America's cultural conservatives. Obama's personal style is similarly comforting to the right. They like the fact that he is sober and calm in demeanour, with a wife and two daughters who could be an advertisement for family values. They would have similarly warmed as he hymned the virtues required for the US to lift itself out of the hole it is in now. The challenges may be new, he said, ""But those values upon which our success depends – hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism – these things are old."" Obama has written before of the pressure on a black man in a mainly white society to appear unthreatening. Whether that explains his serene public style or not matters less than its effect, which is to assure many Americans that there is nothing frighteningly radical about their new president. But just listen to what he said. In one exquisite paragraph, he repudiated – and terminated – the with-us-or-against-us, force-first-not-last, macho foreign policy of the Bush era. Obama recalled the earlier generations who defeated ""fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. Obama delivered a message that many on the left had hoped he would bring, and which many on the right equally feared. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" The notion of a president speaking in such a way, and so directly, to the Muslim world would have been unimaginable just months ago. Obama offered a warning to dictatorships that could apply to those who have long been recipients of US aid and comfort. The rulers of Egypt, among others, may have shifted in their seats as they heard him say ""you are on the wrong side of history; but we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist"". Audiences around the world would have been heartened by that, as they would by Obama's unexpectedly intense focus on climate change. He returned to it several times, until it became one of the speech's clearest threads. ""Each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet,"" he said. Later he vowed to ""harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories"". There was a time when all this would have been condemned as dangerous radicalism in an American politician. But Obama's conservative style – the fact that he invented a new tradition this year, by speaking at inauguration eve dinners in honour of Colin Powell and John McCain – gives him the space to act differently where it matters, on the substance. There is a precedent, albeit indirect, for this trick. It comes from the man Obama hailed during the 2008 campaign as a ""transformational"" president: Ronald Reagan. Once elected, Reagan did not look over his shoulder at the previous consensus. Instead he seized the moment to drive through his own small government agenda, assuming the public would soon come around. He did not feel obliged to meet the centre-left halfway. And yet he wrapped it all in a warmth and charm that ensured it was not threatening. He too was a radical on substance, no matter how cosily traditional his style. So now it could be Obama's turn to be transformational, not just in the words of a speech but in the deeds that Americans will expect from him, starting today. Some early signs are encouraging, including the hint from senior counsellor David Axelrod that the next phase of the federal bail-out will be very different from the first tranche of spending under the man we can now call – with a deep, heartfelt sigh of relief – former President Bush. Obama will focus not on bailing out the banks but US workers. Expect a large dose of government spending on manufacturing industry, especially on projects with a green tinge. What could blow Obama off course? The Republican pollster Frank Luntz warns of two perils. The first danger comes from abroad. Now that Obama has promised to engage America's adversaries, he will enter unpredictable waters. If the new president were to have a summit with, say, the Iranians or even the Russians, and the meeting were to go badly, with Obama somehow seen to have been taken for a ride – then that might burst the Obama bubble. Alternatively, warns Luntz, if House Democrats tug the new president leftwards that could puncture the image of the bipartisan, above the fray leader – reducing him in the minds of the electorate to the status of just another politician. That's plausible enough, given the unpopularity of the Democratic brand in the years since 1980. But it might also badly underestimate the current appetite for change. The triangulations of Bill Clinton may well have been politically necessary 15 years ago. But now, having seen the economy plunge so badly, many Americans seem ready for more radical medicine. Still, none of this should obscure the wonder of what happened in Washington today. Perhaps two million people woke at dawn and made difficult journeys in the frigid cold not to go to the January sales or to see a free concert but to watch a politician become their president. God knows the US has been a difficult country to love these last eight years. But today it showed its most inspiring face – that it is still a nation that cherishes its unique experiment in self-government and still believes that even the darkest chapters in its past can be transcended.",2009-01-20T20:49:28Z,Opinion
30,obama,"Obama inauguration: George Bush - the man who was no longer president • 43rd president leaves note in the Resolute desk for successor• Bushes head to Midland, Texas after ceremony A brass band playing Hail to the Chief just about drowned out the boos. As George Bush stepped onto the inaugural balcony outside Congress, the vast crowd's reception was, at best, lukewarm. The outgoing president, who wore a broad smile for most of the day, briefly allowed a flicker of apprehension to pass across his face. This was not quite the farewell he would have wanted. Bush's final day in public office appeared something of an ordeal. He sat expressionessly through Barack Obama's inaugural address which was coded with criticism of the last eight years, then shifted restlessly during Elizabeth Alexander's celebratory poem. He ignored chants of ""no more Bush"" and ""bye bye Bush"" from the masses in the Mall, grinning gamely as he glad-handed the VIPs sitting alongside him. The two presidents made a joint effort to exude bonhomie. Earlier in the day, as they arrived at the White House for morning coffee, the Obamas presented a gift wrapped with a red ribbon to George and Laura Bush. The smiles were warm and Obama made a point of publicly thanking his predecessor for his ""generosity and cooperation"" during the transition. In keeping with custom, Bush left a note for his successor in the top drawer of the presidential desk in the Oval Office. Press secretary Dana Perino said the letter contained good wishes and were about ""the fabulous new chapter President-elect Obama is about to start"". Saddled with approval ratings in the 20s, Bush has kept his exit low key. His staff organised a leaving party on Sunday evening in a ballroom at Glen Echo Park, a stretch of greenery just outside Washington. The dress code was casual, in part because the venue wasn't heated, but White House staffers clad in fleeces tried to raise spirits by waving giant cut-outs of W's. At a final press briefing, the White House said that even on his last day, Bush was at his desk before 7am for a last round of briefings with his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, and his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. Bush took a stroll around the building's south grounds before the day's ceremonial events began. Arriving for the inauguration, those around Bush looked increasingly old and weary. Dick Cheney turned up in a wheelchair, having injured his back moving boxes into his new home in suburban Virginia. Bush's father, former president George HW Bush, appeared doddery, swaddled against the cold and leaning heavily on a cane. After taking the oath of office and finishing his speech, Obama walked over and hugged Bush. The two first families then went together to the east side of the Capitol, where there was an awkward hiatus of a few minutes as they waited for the departure of a vice-presidential motorcade, swapping remarks and smiling. The departing first family clambered into a helicopter to take them to Andrews air force base where they were due to travel on to a more convivial crowd of well-wishers gathered at a square in Bush's childhood hometown of Midland, Texas. For the journey south, the Bushes rode on the blue and white Boeing 747 usually known as Air Force One - but temporarily renamed Special Air Mission 28000, given that its passenger was no longer president.",2009-01-20T19:48:30Z,News
31,obama,"Londoners toast Obama's arrival in the White House  Who needs Washington when there's west London? Approximately 3,660 miles away from the White House, the champagne was giddily sloshing, alongside the occasional latte grande. Elisabeth Murdoch, her husband, PR maestro Matthew Freud, and Ruth Rogers, proprieter of the dining room for everyone important, The River Cafe in London, pooled together their impressive address books to organise an inauguration party, which was held this afternoon. Where? In Notting Hill, of course, an area of London that increasingly seems to exist purely for Americans. Aptly, if inevitably, among the guests was director Richard Curtis, who pretty much sold the area to foreigners with his cinematic ode to the area, Notting Hill, which depicted an unlikely Anglo-American love affair. And that transatlantic adoration was in full flow in the Electric Cinema on Portobello Road. ""Ruth called me at what, 4pm on Sunday?"" began the clubbable Freud, looking to his co-host for confirmation. ""Exactly, 4pm,"" she nodded, staring at the cinema screen which was showing events on Sky News. Well, you wouldn't expect CNN at a Murdoch party. ""And by Monday, it was all organised,"" he finished. Neither Rogers nor Freud are virgins to Obama parties. One fundraiser held by Freud and Murdoch last year raised $500,000, allegedly the biggest sum raised at an event where Obama was not present. ""We in Britain have a political regime that's in its maturity – can I be any more tactful? So to see someone so new is inspiring,"" said Freud. Were they not tempted to go to DC for the inauguration? ""Real life got in the way,"" replied Murdoch, looking for her children in the crowd. ""And this party was fun to organise because everyone could come, not just Americans,"" added Rogers. Everyone was, indeed, there. Alan Rickman and Antonia Fraser chatted by the bar. Sam Taylor-Wood kissed Thandie Newton hello. Jemima Goldsmith and Elle Macpherson appeared to be engaged in a competition over who had the most shampoo advert-worthy hair and Bob Geldof sulked at the back. Perhaps to signal that, contrary to all appearances, he was excited about the afternoon's upcoming events, he wore an alarming pink jumper. Proving that all famous people know each other, everyone kissed everyone. And then, into this glossy mix came the latest addition to the west London scene: the oligarch. As the lights in the cinema were beginning to dim in anticipation of Obama's speech, Evgeny Lebedev – the son of Aleksander Lebedev, the Russian billionaire and possibly the future proprietor of the London Evening Standard – crept quietly in. At the first sight of a journalist's notebook, Evgeny fled to the bar, accompanied by a protective Freud. Claudia Schiffer was chattier. ""I've always been a fan of Obama,"" she avowed. Had she considered going to DC for the inauguration? ""Oh no, it's much more comfortable here. It's like watching in your living room,"" she replied, spotting fellow model Laura Bailey through the waiters carrying trays of champagne. So there were oligarchs and authors, supermodels and chefs. The only people that seemed to be missing were, funnily enough, Americans. But the cupcakes with American flag icing were some compensation for the absence of Gwyneth and Madonna. By 4.45pm the lights were down and most people were in their seats. It was like being at a very A-list film premiere. All small talk ceased, apart from the occasional urgent dash to the bar for another glass of champagne. And just when everything was beginning to feel a little solemn, the composer of Cats swept in. So what brought Andrew Lloyd-Webber, aka, Lord Lloyd-Webber of Sydmonton, here? He gave a little chuckle, ""Well, I was just filming at the BBC around the corner."" So it was convenient? ""Exactly!""",2009-01-20T17:49:31Z,News
32,obama,"Obama's speech More prose than poetry means: it's time to get down to work. A presidential inaugural address can be pitched either to the ages, replete with eternal verities, or to the particular moment, cataloguing the challenges of the day, but rarely to both. I think most of us expected the former from Barack Hussein Obama, whose most stirring oratories have certainly sung with ageless poetry. This speech had those moments, to be sure, and Obama from time to time reached back to Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and even to Paul the Apostle. But what was surprising was how rooted in the current moment the speech was. Obama chose to speak in specific terms – one might even say programmatic ones – about the dire present moment and his plans for how to get out of it. Only a few minutes into the speech he was mentioning jobs, homes and healthcare, and building roads and bridges, and investing in new sources of energy and improving education. A few of the lines were so on-message that they would have worked well in a closing statement during a presidential debate. There is precedent for this. Franklin Roosevelt's inaugural addresses, his first and second ones in particular, were pitched directly at the moment Americans faced then. That we are in the midst of an economic crisis greater than any since Roosevelt's time obviously motivated Obama to move his rhetoric in this direction. But I felt he may have pressed a little too far in that direction. When he mentioned ""electric grids"" and ""digital lines,"" he sounded like he has about a half a beat away from diving into a discussion of the competing merits of corn- versus switchgrass-based ethanol. Another way in which the speech was geared toward the moment: it was, in parts, a coded but unmistakably clear denunciation of the Bush administration. ""As for our common defense,"" he said, ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" The line drew a big cheer from the nearly two-million-strong Obama enthusiasts on the mall, and they knew exactly what he meant: no more Guantanamos, no more torture, no more Dick Cheney-style governance (and the sight of Cheney in that wheelchair…what was he doing packing his own boxes anyway?). And how about the line about how America's founding fathers ""understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please?"" Obama may be ready to cooperate with congressional Republicans, as he has often stated, but it has to be said that at least with regard to Bush and Cheney, even Obama's penchant for post-partisanship clearly has its limits. The speech's most stirring passages were directed not to Americans but to the world, and here, I think the speech was more in line with the high expectations. Here, he moved away from Roosevelt and leaned more on John Kennedy's 1961 address. His words ""to the people of poor nations"" were moving, and those addressed ""to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent"" were stern. The world will be listening to this president with more care and respect than most, so one hopes that over the next four years those words are backed up by some actions. If the speech was mildly underwhelming, I suppose I'd say this. There were many times during the campaign when I, and other political junkies of my acquaintance, thought Obama was screwing something up. A week or a month later, we almost invariably saw that maybe he was right after all. So maybe he thought, let's put the poetry on the shelf. It's time now to get to work. He's got a lot of that ahead of him, so it's understandable I suppose if that, not rhetoric, is what is foremost in his mind.",2009-01-20T17:36:15Z,Opinion

34,obama,"Obama inauguration: Words of history ... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks • Chief speechwriter known as president's mind reader • Young aide studied past inaugural orations When Barack Obama steps up to the podium to deliver his inaugural address, one man standing anonymously in the crowd will be paying especially close attention. With his cropped hair, five o'clock shadow and boyish face, he might look out of place among the dignitaries, though as co-author of the speech this man has more claim than most to be a witness to this moment of history. Jon Favreau, 27, is, as Obama himself puts it, the president's mind reader. He is one of the youngest chief speechwriters on record in the White House, and, despite such youth, was at the centre of discussions of the content of today's speech, one which has so much riding on it. For a politician whose rise to prominence was largely built upon his powers as an orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of speech-making. But today's effort will tower over all previous ones. It is not just that Obama has set an extremely high bar by invoking the inaugural speeches of Abraham Lincoln as his inspiration - admitting to feeling ""intimidated"" when he read them. It is also that, as he begins his term with the US in an economic crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to kick start his presidency with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and motivates the American people. The tone of the speech could be decisive in determining how the public responds to his first 100 days, as Franklin Roosevelt's famous line ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" helped to determine his. Obama aides have let it be known that a key theme will be restoring responsibility - both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, talks of a ""culture of responsibility"" that would ""not just be asked of the American people; its leaders must also lead by example."" In composing the high notes of the speech, Obama has leant on Favreau, whom he discovered almost by chance four years ago when the younger man was working on John Kerry's failed presidential bid. ""Favs"" has since studied Obama's speech patterns and cadences with the intensity of a stalker. He memorised the 2004 speech to the Democratic national convention which first brought Obama into the limelight. He is said to carry Obama's autobiography, Dreams From My Father, wherever he goes. As a result, last November when Favreau sat down to write the first draft of the inaugural address, he could conjure up his master's voice as if an accomplished impersonator. That skill had been put to almost daily use in the 18 months of brutal campaigning on the presidential trail. Favreau would be up most nights until 3am, honing the next day's stump speeches in a caffeine haze of espressos and Red Bull energy drinks, taking breaks to play the video game Rock Band. He coined a phrase for this late-night deadline surfing: ""crashing"". He crashed his way through all Obama's most memorable speeches. He wrote the draft of one that helped to turn Iowa for Obama while closeted in a coffee shop in Des Moines. For the presidential election, he wrote two speeches: one for a victory, one for defeat. When the result came through, he emailed his best friend: ""Dude, we won. Oh my God."" The tension between such youthful outbursts and his onerous role has sometimes cost the 27-year-old. In December, pictures of him and a friend mocking a cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton at a party, Favreau's hand on her breast, were posted on Facebook to his huge embarrassment. Obama is an accomplished writer in his own right, and the process of drafting with his mind reader is collaborative. The inaugural speech has shuttled between them four or five times, following an initial hour-long meeting in which the president-elect spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on his computer. Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His team interviewed historians and speech writers, studied periods of crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he took up residence in Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first draft. The end result will be uttered on the steps of the Capitol. Obama's mind reader has crashed his way through yet another deadline. • This article was amended on Friday 23 January 2009. Jon Favreau, age 27, is not the youngest chief speechwriter in the White House. He shares that honour with James Fallows, who served as Jimmy Carter's speechwriter at the same age. This has been corrected.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
35,obama,"Gordon Brown may not be first EU leader to meet President Obama Downing Street spokesman says prime minister 'does not attach too much importance to who has what meetings when' Gordon Brown may not be the first European leader to meet Barack Obama after he becomes US president, Downing Street indicated today. The prime minister is writing a letter to Obama, congratulating him on entering office and assuring him that Britain ""stands ready to work very closely with his administration on many of the international challenges that we face"", Brown's spokesman told reporters. The prime minister would like to be the first to be invited to the Obama White House. But Downing Street pointed out that Obama is due to come to Britain for a meeting of the G20 world leaders – 19 major economies plus the EU – on 2 April and that Jacques Chirac, the former French president, was the first European leader to meet George Bush, Obama's predecessor. ""We wouldn't attach too much importance to who has what meetings when,"" said the spokesman. ""The important thing is whether or not you share the same values and have similar approaches and are able to work together on challenges."" The spokesman said he was not sure whether the prime minister would be able to watch the inauguration and Obama's first speech as president live on television, but said he would certainly try to see at least part of it at some point today. At this morning's weekly cabinet meeting in Downing Street, Brown told ministers that the government shared ""many of the same values"" as Obama and had adopted a very similar approach on the global economic downturn. Briefing reporters on the cabinet meeting, Brown's spokesman said: ""The prime minister emphasised the importance of working very closely with the incoming US administration. ""He said the government shared many of the same values of President Obama and his team, and is adopting a very similar approach to the positions that the incoming president has been setting out on some of the big global challenges that we face: first and foremost, the economy, where Britain and America are taking similar action to deal with problems in the credit and financial market, and taking a similar approach on fiscal policy."" Brown told the cabinet that his government and Obama's administration ""share a very similar view on the role of the environment"", said the spokesman. And he added: ""We will want to work very closely with the Obama administration on the Middle East, on Iraq and on Afghanistan. ""On the Middle East, we share support for the two-state solution and want to work with the US administration and others for a successful ceasefire.""",2009-01-20T11:10:18Z,News
36,obama,"Barack Obama's speeches: 2002 to 2006  First speech on Iraq as President Bush authorises going to war 2 October 2002 Federal Plaza, Chicago I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne. What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics. Keynote address to the 2004 Democratic convention 27 July 2004 Fleet centre, Boston Even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here - the almost wilful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope! On black community responsibilities 1 May 2005 National Association for Advancement of Colored People, Detroit Our grandparents used to tell us that being black means you have to work twice as hard to succeed in life. And so I ask today, can we honestly say our kids are working twice as hard as the kids in India and China who are graduating ahead of us, with better test scores and the tools they need to kick our butts on the job market? Can we honestly say our teachers are working twice as hard, or our parents? In defence of women's right to choose 10 November 2005 National Women's Law Centre, Washington The other side knows that equal opportunity has always been a winning argument for us. And that's why those who don't want to make it a reality choose to fight on other terms. They make sure that in any given campaign or debate, the only woman's issue that ever comes up is not equal pay or healthcare or family leave, but the narrowest, most divisive issues like late-term abortion. Now, the ability for a woman to make decisions about how many children to have and when - without interference from the government - is one of the most fundamental freedoms we have. We all know, becoming a parent is one of the most - if not the most - important jobs there is. No one should make that decision for a woman and her family but them. And we must keep defending their right to make this choice in the years to come. On ending America's fossil fuel addiction 3 April 2006 Chicago When it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change is coming from the very people who are running the country. By now, the Bush administration's record on climate change is almost legendary. This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans. This is the administration that didn't try to improve the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to stem climate change. And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a Nasa scientist for letting the rest of us know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal ... This is not a serious effort. Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program. It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it. The challenge of going into politics, with 'that funny name' 11 May 2006 Emily's List annual lunch, Washington I remember when I first ran for the state senate - my very first race. A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running. Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife. And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen. I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature. And everywhere I went I'd get two questions: First, they'd ask, ""Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"" Because people just couldn't pronounce it. They'd call me ""Alabama,"" or they'd call me ""Yo Mama"". And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya. And the second thing people would ask me was, ""You seem like a nice young man. You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organise voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"" On the embarrassment of his first Democratic convention 2 June 2006 University of Massachusetts, Boston It's always great to be back in Boston. As some of you may have heard, I was here a few years ago to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention. It was an amazing experience for me. A humbling honour. A tremendous opportunity. And if you had come up to me a few years earlier and told me I'd be there, I would've politely told you that you were out of your mind. Let me tell you what happened at the last convention I had been to. It was the year 2000, and I had just gotten my rear-end handed to me in my very first race for Congress. Didn't even make it past the primary. I was a little depressed, and more than a little broke, but some friends suggested that I get my mind off it by going to Los Angeles, where that year's Democratic convention was being held. So I decided to go. And when my plane landed in LA, I got my luggage, walked on over to the Hertz counter, filled out all the forms to rent a car, gave my credit card to the nice woman behind the counter who, moments later, handed it back to me and said, ""Mr Obama, it seems we have a problem."" That's right, my credit card was denied. After 30 more minutes of haggling, I finally made it to the convention, only to learn that I was thought of so highly by the Democratic party that my credentials barely granted me access to the men's room - let alone backstage where all the action was. And so, being the VIP that I was, I spent the rest of the week as the guy in the room who nobody knew, but everyone knew didn't belong. Needless to say, when they asked me to be the convention's keynote speaker just four years later, I made sure I was getting a car. All joking aside, receiving that honour was a welcome change - and, as MasterCard could attest, more than a little unlikely.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
37,obama,"My fellow Americans What paragraph would you like to sneak into Obama's inauguration speech today? Jeffrey Sachs: An end to extreme poverty Our generation's unique challenge is to live peacefully and sustainably on a crowded planet. I commit America to work with all the world to end extreme poverty in our generation, convert to sustainable energy and ecosystem use, and stabilise the world's population by 2050, before our numbers and resource demands overwhelm the planet and our fragile capacity to co-operate. Our wars are distractions from these challenges; today's enemies will become tomorrow's partners in shared prosperity. Hans Blix: No more arms races The cold war ended nearly 20 years ago. We and our adversaries no longer target each other. More and more we need to join hands to tackle threats facing the whole world: financial disarray, climate change, diseases, nuclear proliferation, and terrorists or governments acting erratically. The US must remain militarily strong but will gain in security and save sorely needed resources by avoiding new arms races and reaching global agreements on arms control. Patricia Williams: Let science inform faith It is my profound hope that in the years to come, we may find ourselves united in love of our shared home, not only defence of the homeland; in reverence for the constitution, not merely obeisance to the nation-state; in collaborative debate as well as decisive action; and in peace, not only pacification. Let us also ensure that science informs our faith, and that our faith not be blind to the rich diversity of community and human need. Benjamin Barber: Creating opportunity in crisis In the midst of crisis, we can prime the credit pump and push consumers back into the mall. Or we can turn the fiscal disaster into an opportunity to change habits and attitudes and create a new and green sustainable economy; encourage saving not spending; invest in education and culture; lower energy consumption and slow growth; give government help to homeowners and job-holders, rather than banks and corporations. We should put our pain to the purposes of birthing a new democratic civil society in which the economy serves us, not the other way round. Pankaj Mishra: Influence trumps force In international affairs, I will always bear in mind the words of George Kennan, neglected prophet of cold war America, who believed our nation would exercise its greatest influence by manifesting civilised values rather than by trying to impose them on others through military force: any message we try to bring to others will be effective only if it is in accord with what we are to ourselves, and if this is something sufficiently impressive to compel the respect and confidence of a world which, despite all its material difficulties, is still more ready to recognise and respect spiritual distinction than material opulence. Jayati Ghosh: A commitment to peaceful multilateralism I commit my administration to peaceful multilateralism. Politically, the US will not resort to military intervention until all other solutions have been explored. I will work for lasting and just peace in the Middle East, beginning with quick action to stop the carnage in Gaza. Economically, we will strongly back international moves to regulate finance, to make trade less unequal and to allow greater policy autonomy for developing countries. My government's fiscal stimulus package will be oriented to making production and consumption patterns within the US more sustainable and will address problems of excessive resource use and climate change. John Pilger: Redress for criminal wars My fellow human beings, I pledge on this historic day that the US will cease its multiple acts of aggression against humanity and withdraw immediately from Iraq, Afghanistan and 770 military bases around the world. I will instruct the international criminal court that the US no longer shuns its authority and have instructed that 30 names from the Bush administration be submitted for immediate prosecution. Saffron Burrows: Just treatment for prisoners Much can be known about a country by the way it treats its prisoners. If there is a disparity between the values that we say we stand for and our actions internationally then we have become a dissonant society that does not practise what it preaches. We must stand for what we believe in: a society that cares about all people. There can be no reconciliation with and redemption for those we have inhumanely incarcerated, wrongfully imprisoned and tortured without truth-telling and justice. Only then will we have the energy to go forward and, by example, work to shift the world in real ways because we have clean hands. Joe Queenan: We all have to accept blame for the financial crisis Right here and now I'd like you all to stop placing all the blame for the current mess on my predecessor. Every last one of you who bought a house in the past 10 years knew that the whole thing was a scam, that the inflated value of your house was the result of the subprime con-job. Every single one of you who invested in the stockmarket knew the whole thing was a house of cards, that when stocks are trading at 40 times current earnings the market is rigged. Every last one of you tolerated George Bush when he made you rich, just as our British friends tolerated Maggie Thatcher and Tony Blair and only turned against them when things started to go south. The fault lies not in the stars nor in the yellow rose of Texas, dear Brutus. It lies in us. Eric Hobsbawm: A Middle East resolution Although it will be difficult to make a decisive break with the policies of the past administration in the Middle East, I intend to do so. Without a solution to the Palestinian problem, no stable or promising future in this region will be possible, including long-term security for Israel. I hope my Jewish fellow Americans recognise that the major obstacle to such a solution is the unwillingness of Israel to accept a viable Palestinian state. Since Israel is largely dependent on the US, I propose to exercise pressure to change Israel's policies. Rebecca Solnit: Change must come from all And to the people who brought me to the presidency: remember that it was your power that gave me mine and that it is now your task not to surrender that power, either by believing that I will do the work of forming a more perfect union and a more just society for you, or by believing that your goal has been accomplished. I will be your president, but you must be my civil society, pushing me onward to the radical changes we need to make. Hope in me, but do not trust me; make me. Robin Morgan: Without justice for women, there is justice for none I would like to affirm the words of my new secretary of state at her confirmation hearings: of particular concern to me is the plight of women – the majority of the world's unhealthy, unschooled, unfed and unpaid. Violence against women, within their families and from the outside: this is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. If half the world's population remains vulnerable to economic, political, legal, and social marginalisation, our hope of advancing democracy and prosperity is in serious jeopardy. The US must be an unequivocal, unwavering voice in support of women's rights in every country on every continent. David Landau: Impose a two-state solution After 1967, the Arab mainstream said: no peace, no recognition, no negotiations. The Israeli mainstream said: no PLO state, no ""internationalisation of the conflict"", no imposed solution. Five of those noes have gone. They've become the province of extremists, enemies of peace. These very days, Israel urges the return of PLO rule to Gaza, and of international forces to its border. My administration, committed to Israel's security and to Palestinian independence, will use its best endeavours to impose a solution – the two-state solution that all sane people want – on the two nations. And I will expect and assist both to impose it on their respective enemies of peace. Michael Tomasky: Leading by moral example To the rest of the world, I say that we are your friend. The US has been most successful when it has led by moral example, not by coercion or force. In the coming years we will hew to this standard. I am as resolved to isolate and defeat our enemies as any American could be - no one should misunderstand that - we will do that best when we adhere to our highest principles; that's when the people of the world will see most clearly that our way - freedom of speech and worship, equality for women, the rule of law - is the best way, and the people of America will see those striving people across the world as brothers and sisters in the fight for liberty and dignity. Bonnie Greer: The lesson of Lassie A joke the late, great Lenny Bruce used to tell is: ""What's the difference - in a movie - between Lassie and a black man? At the end of the movie, Lassie lives."" In other words, the dog who didn't talk got a chance to serve another day. That's the way it was, and there are many of you in this audience today who know the deep meaning of Bruce's joke, and who know what I mean. Now I can't say that that movie is quite over yet... but the credits are well and truly rolling! Bethany McLean: Seek economic development, not fraud and fiction The conventional wisdom is that more regulation and better ethics would have prevented this economic apocalypse. But it's a mistake to believe that either one offers perfect protection. In the wake of Enron, Congress enacted new rules. Sarbanes Oxley did nothing to prevent the current crisis, because regulation tends to be a modern Maginot line. As for the oxymoron of corporate ethics, put faith in that at your peril. What might work? Change the incentives. Reward our business leaders when they build companies that are successful over the long term. Make it more difficult for fortunes to be made on the backs of short-term profits that turn out to be totally illusory. Then you might get real economic development, not fraud and fiction. Jonathan Farley: It is time to re-imagine America America is today something the Founding Fathers could never imagine. It is not enough to say we will torture no more. We won't. It is not enough to say Guantánamo must close. It will. It is not enough to say no more wars based on lies. Those wars will end. But these are things we stand against. What do we stand for? Free healthcare, for all. Free education, for all. A living wage for honest work. The development of wind and solar power. The shoring-up of our infrastructure. It is time to re-imagine America.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion
38,obama,"'Barack is our son': Kenyans celebrate their US president • Thousands gather in hope of respite from domestic problems• Schools, sports teams and beers named in Obama's honour He may be the about to become the 44th president of the US, but today Kenyans have been celebrating Barack Obama's inauguration as if he were their own leader. In Kogelo, the village in western Kenya where Obama's father grew up, primary school classrooms have been converted into makeshift hotels with names such as Mama Sister, Something Cold and Connie of Siaya, selling tea, chapatti and popcorn. In the playground the commotion came not from children but male traditional dancers wearing pink and blue sisal skirts, large feathers on their arms and, in the case of one elderly man, a cloak made of the silky black and white fur of a colobus monkey. Loudspeakers broadcast speeches by the man whose achievement many hundreds of people had come to revel in today. ""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old maths teacher at the Barack Obama primary school. ""He is our son."" And not just a village son, or even a son of the Luo ethnic group, but a child of the entire country, judging by the parties taking place across Kenya. Along the coast, hotels have organised night-long ""Yes We Did"" bashes, while in the capital, Nairobi, where special Obama prayer services are scheduled for this afternoon, bars are anticipating one of the busiest nights of the year. In western towns such as Kakamega and Kisumu, tens of thousands of people are expected to watch the inauguration on giant screens – and forget about the grand corruption scandals and looming famine in their own country. ""Everybody is dwelling on the Obama victory,"" said Jael Lieta, a 24-year-old radio presenter in Kisumu. ""It is a great chance to take a break from the bad news in Kenya."" It is also a chance to make money. The country's biggest brewer, which already has a brand of beer called Senator, has launched a special edition President lager. A mobile phone company is selling one-off Yes We Can handsets. In Nairobi, a hospitality institute has been advertising for new students by declaring: ""Obamamania is set to grow Kenya's tourism industry – this is change you can believe in"". It is true that Kogelo, home to about 5,000 people, has already become a sightseeing attraction for foreigner visitors. Signs for ""tourist hotels"" have sprung up along the main road since November's election result. With a planned museum yet to be built, the only real sight is the home of Obama's grandmother Mama Sarah, who, along with several other close relatives, has travelled to the inauguration in Washington. A group of camera-toting South Korean students seemed devastated to hear this, only for the police guarding the house to enter into the party spirit by allowing them a brief look around the property. A short walk up the road at the primary school, vendors hawked commemorative T-shirts, caps, calendars, traditional print wraps and lapel badges with slogans such as ""Obama the 44th"". After buying a badge, Vitalis Omondi, 36, said: ""I never believed that Bush would agree to leave office and allow Obama in – that doesn't happen here."" A publishing company was selling a locally written biography of Obama for £2.50. Nearby a photographer had set up a stall selling framed photographic portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is also from the region. Students at the adjacent secondary school had arrived for class in their neat blue and white uniforms, but were soon released from their lessons. George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study, was among a group of boys rushing towards the primary school football field where Obama FC was about to take to the pitch. ""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said. ""If you believe something then you can do it."" Otieno's dream is to become a lawyer, and he is hoping the Obama presidency will help him get a scholarship to a US university. The expectation that Kogelo, and Kenya more broadly, will receive a boost from Washington in the form of grants and favours over the next four years is not an uncommon sentiment among ordinary people. Writing in the Nation newspaper today, the columnist Macharia Gaitho said that while Kenyans were celebrating louder than the American ""owners of the party"", these types of expectations needed to be lowered. ""True, he [Obama] does have an attachment to the country,"" he wrote, ""but it would be foolish of us to wait for him to direct Air Force 1 [sic] and the entire American fleet to bring goodies to our starving shores.""",2009-01-20T13:25:43Z,News

Our time to write a new chapter in the American story. Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up. And then some day, some day, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose. They can say that this was the time when America found its way. They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again. Recollections of his father, while visiting Kenya 28 August 2006 University of Nairobi The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987. I had just finished three years of work as a community organiser in low-income neighbourhoods of Chicago, and was about to enrol in law school. My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month. My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip. Instead of a motorcade, we travelled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already 10 years old. When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road. I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi. When we went upcountry, we travelled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap. But it was a magical trip. To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty. I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left. And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him. I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called ""boy"" by his employers for most of his life. I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the ""Pipeline"" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles. I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult. I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had travelled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya. In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early 60s, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation. And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments. His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years. And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well. Statement to the Senate on homeland security 27 September 2006 Washington The vast majority of the folks in Guantánamo, I suspect, are there for a reason. There are a lot of dangerous people. Particularly dangerous are people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Ironically, those are the guys who are going to get real military procedures because they are going to be charged by the government. But detainees who have not committed war crimes - or where the government's case is not strong - may not have any recourse whatsoever. The bottom line is this: current procedures under the CSRT [combatant status review tribunals] are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the government's case and has no way of proving his innocence. I would like somebody in this chamber, somebody in this government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. I know that every time I think about my two little girls and worry for their safety - when I wonder if I really can tuck them in at night and know that they are safe from harm. I have as big of a stake as anybody on the other side of the aisle and anybody in this administration in capturing terrorists and incapacitating them. I would gladly take up arms myself against any terrorist threat to make sure my family is protected. But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantánamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence. This is not just an entirely fictional scenario, by the way. We have already had reports by the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantánamo should not have been there. As one US commander of Guantánamo told the Wall Street Journal: ""Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks."" Global summit on Aids and the church 1 December 2006 Saddleback church campus, California I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren. Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by Aids, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do. Their decision to devote their time, their money and their purpose-driven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and Aids. The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease. Statement to the Senate on the Iraq war de-escalation act 30 January 2007 Washington Mr President, today in Iraq we sadly find ourselves at the very point I feared most when I opposed giving the president the open-ended authority to wage this war in 2002 - an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the midst of a country torn by civil war. The American people have waited and the American people have been patient. We have given chance after chance for a resolution that has not come, and, more importantly, watched with horror and grief the tragic loss of thousands of brave young American soldiers. The time for waiting in Iraq is over. The days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close. And the need to bring this war to an end is here. Announcement of entry to Democratic presidential race 10 February 2007 Springfield, Illinois Let me tell you how I came to be here. As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state. I moved to Illinois over two decades ago. I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections. But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organiser for $13,000 a year. And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America. My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighbourhoods. I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closures. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill. It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith. After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need. I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate. It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state senator. It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and labourers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamouring to be heard. I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today ... It was here, in Springfield, where north, south, east and west come together, that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America. And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States. 'Super Tuesday' Democratic race election-night speech 5 February 2008 Chicago What began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the corn fields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers, students and seniors stood up in numbers we've never seen. They stood up to say that maybe this year, we don't have to settle for a politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems. This time we can finally do something about healthcare we can't afford or mortgages we can't pay. This time can be different. Their voices echoed from the hills of New Hampshire to the deserts of Nevada, where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe Washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists any more. They reached the coast of South Carolina when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender; that crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children; that we can come together and build an America that gives every child, everywhere, the opportunity to live their dreams. This time can be different. And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states north and south, east and west, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change. A chorus that cannot be ignored. That cannot be deterred. This time can be different because this campaign for the presidency is different. It's different not because of me, but because of you. Because you are tired of being disappointed and tired of being let down. You're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to Washington. Because the lobbyists just write another cheque. Or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should. Or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
40,obama,"Obama's inauguration provokes tepid response in Russia  Today's inauguration of Barack Obama provoked a lukewarm response in Russia, with state television covering the event patchily, and the only public displays of attention breaking out in overtly expatriate venues. 'I don't think the relationship between our countries will change greatly,' Igor Krasavin, 28, a philosophy lecturer from Yekaterinburg predicted after the speech. He added, however: 'Personally I like him.' Most Russians appear to agree - praising his 'powerful' delivery but also noting he looked a bit nervous, especially at the beginning. They were generally optimistic that Obama would now bring positive changes, though. 'I expect him to practice a greener kind of politics,' Konstantin Zgurovsky, 56, an ecologist said. 'I think he will pay greater attention to domestic problems and pull the US army out of Iraq.' Others were more equivocal. 'Unquestionably there will be changes. But what they are we still don't know yet. I hope he quickly resolves the US's crisis, so that Russia's economic problems become easier,' Tatyana Bazlova, 27, from Pskov said. There was also general agreement that the 44th president could only be an improvement on the disastrous 43rd - seen in Russia, as elsewhere, as a warmonger. Obama's speech was seen by many as a direct repudiation of the Bush legacy. 'I hope that Obama means that Russia and the US develop a pragmatic partnership. I hope Obama prefers to use his intelligence rather than war as a means of influence,' Alena Pravidla, 31, from Moscow noted.",2009-01-20T17:20:42Z,News
41,obama,"Iraqis wary of US president's message of change Barack Obama's inauguration speech fails to resonate in country that will help shape legacy of his first years in office Many Iraqis seemed nonplussed at the swearing-in of Barack Obama, with some not knowing the inauguration was taking place and others consumed by the fallout from the previous presidency. President Obama's messages of change and remaking America have yet to resonate in the country that will help shape the legacy of his first years in office. Some Baghdadis were however impressed by his inauguration speech. ""If he can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over,"" said Abu Ali, the owner of a sparkling new restaurant, Shisha Cafe, in the city's Karada district. ""I believe he is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests,"" he added. ""That's it."" Another cafe-goer, Haitham Sarkis, said his family had long ago stopped listening to Obama's predecessor George Bush and become dispirited by his last three years in office. ""He kept telling us one thing, yet we were living the other,"" he said. ""This man never knew us and we are left with a massive mess that we must now pick up – not the new president."" The US presence on the streets of Baghdad may be slowly diminishing, but the withdrawal of the occupying forces is not generating a rise in America's popularity. Iraqi children and youths regularly taunt each other by removing their shoes and threatening to throw them – mimicking the local journalist who humiliated Bush during his last visit in December. ""Obama won't get the same treatment,"" said a nurse from the northern suburb of Adamiyeh, Um Nassir. ""But he won't have too long to prove himself to us."" Bush, however, is not a villain to all. ""He always said history will judge him,"" said parliamentarian Samira Musawi. ""But God will judge him as well and God has used Bush to remove the evil of Saddam and set the Iraqi nation free. It is now our responsibility to find the right way to direct this change.""",2009-01-20T17:47:22Z,News
42,obama,"Barack Obama's speeches: February 2008 to election night  'Potomac Primary' election night 12 February 2008 Madison, Wisconsin Now when I start talking like this, some folks tell me that I've got my head in the clouds. That I need a reality check. That we're still offering false hope. But my own story tells me that in the United States of America, there has never been anything false about hope. I should not be here today. I was not born into money or status. I was born to a teenage mom in Hawaii, and my dad left us when I was two. But my family gave me love, they gave me education, and most of all they gave me hope - hope that in America, no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it, and fight for it, and work for it ... The politics of hope does not mean hoping things come easy. Because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody, somewhere, stood up when it was hard; stood up when they were told, ""No, you can't"", and said, ""Yes, we can."" 'The race speech' after the Reverend Wright controversy 18 March 2008 Philadelphia Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough"". We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarisation, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all ... For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labour. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighbourhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talkshow hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle-class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favour the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognising they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. Final primary night: presumptive Democratic nominee speech 3 June 2008 St Paul, Minnesota Tonight, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been travelled. Millions of voices have been heard. And because of what you said - because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another - a journey that will bring a new and better day to America. Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office. I have not just competed with them as rivals, I have learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party, and leaders that America will turn to for years to come. That is particularly true for the candidate who has travelled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. We've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But our party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honour to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Acceptance speech at the Democratic convention 28 August 2008 Mile High stadium, Denver We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush. America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough ..."" You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI bill. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States. Election night victory speech 4 November 2008 Grant Park, Chicago If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer ... I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organised, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory ... The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. • Edited speeches reprinted courtesy of Obama for America, the official website of the Barack Obama election campaign (barackobama.com).

43,obama,"Obama's inbox The new president's concerns in the coming months - the top priorities, the key players, and the risks Wars Top priority Obama will meet military chiefs tomorrow to discuss how to withdraw US troops from Iraq and win the war in Afghanistan. He is committed to a big reduction in the 140,000-plus US troops in Iraq within 18 months and to send an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. Pentagon sources have reported that Obama's team were shocked that problems attached to both wars were worse than anticipated. Key player Defence secretary Robert Gates is liked in the Pentagon for having brought order and pragmatism back to the department. The ""surge"" policy, in which an extra 30,000 US troops were sent to Iraq in 2007, was implemented by General David Petraeus but it was the brainchild of Gates. He now has to try to pacify Afghanistan. Risks A Pentagon source said last week that if the Iranians had planted a covert unit in the Bush administration, they could not have done a better job than ex-defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz. The Iranian influence in Iraq and Afghanistan grows daily. If the US pulls out 60,000 troops from Iraq within 16 months, 80,000 will still be left, which will disappoint those who want a total pullout. Economy Top priority Obama's economic team has been holding regular sessions but tomorrow they will gather for the first time in the White House. There is only so long they will be able to blame the recession on the Bush administration. They are proposing a spending bill along the lines of Roosevelt's New Deal, designed to create three to four million jobs. The latest estimate for the package is $800bn (about £540bn). Key player As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Tim Geithner, now head of the Treasury, was at the centre of many of the Wall Street crises last year. He now has to implement a plant to prevent the US falling into the worst recession since the 1930s. He has got off to a bad start, with the revelation that he failed to pay his taxes, which has slowed his US Senate confirmation hearings. Risks The obvious one is that the stimulus package will not work. Bush brought in tax cuts to encourage spending and it made almost no difference. If Obama's handling of the economy fails, the Democrats could be punished in Congressional elections at the end of next year and in 2012 he could end up as a one-term president. Republicans in Congress are complaining about the scale of public spending. Environment Top priority Obama has promised to implement fuel-efficiency policies, reduce US dependence on foreign oil and take steps to tackle global warming. Some of the spending from the stimulus package is to be diverted to development of environment-friendly technologies. One of the main tests is whether Obama signs up to an agreement on emissions to replace the Kyoto protocol Key player Stephen Chu, the physicist and Nobel Prize winner, who will run the energy department, has criticised the use of coal and nuclear power. He has warned of ""dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate system"" if the US and other countries refuse to reduce greenhouse gases. He has to implement election promises to cut emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050 Risks The recession may not allow Obama and Chu to spend as much on energy projects as they had hoped. There is scepticism too about whether wind, solar and other alternative power sources are capable of offering a significant replacement for current energy sources. Chu, before being nominated for the energy job, had been an advocate of higher US taxes on petrol, but that is likely to be heard less often. Foreign policy Top priority Obama's plan to restore the US reputation in the world after eight years of the Bush administration should be relatively easy, with goodwill flowing his way. Harder though will be dealing with the foreign policy challenges confronting him, from the Israel-Palestinian conflict to Iran, North Korea and Pakistan. He could announce the appointment of a special Middle East envoy tomorrow. Key player As US senator for New York, Hillary Clinton positioned herself as a close friend of Israel and adopted aggressive rhetoric towards Iran. But as first lady, she called for an independent Palestinian state when it was not administration policy. She is almost certain to mix a threat of tougher economic sanctions against Iran with an offer of direct talks. Relations with Europe will almost certainly be much better. Risks There is a strong chance Iran will resist US overtures. The US could probably live with a nuclear-armed Iran but Israel may not, and an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear plants would create havoc. One big worry is Pakistan and the danger that the instability in Afghanistan will spill over the border. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is almost certain to continue to defy the best efforts of outside diplomats. Domestic policy Top priority Obama has promised to tackle health and education, decrying the state of public schools and the lack of health care, not just for the poorest but many working-class families. He has appointed Arne Duncan, a friend from Chicago days with a reputation for toughness, to reform education. Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader, will be deputed to extend the inadequate health insurance umbrella. Key player Rahm Emmanuel, White House chief of staff, will have to push through Congress policies the Republicans regard as contentious. Emmanuel is a bruiser and his abrasive style could prove counterproductive in relations with Republican members of Congress. And there could be hot-tempered exchanges with members of the cabinet, advisers and departmental officials. Risks The biggest problem is that the economic stimulus package, though vast, could mean funds Obama had anticipated for health care and education might have to be cut back. Reforms in health and education may turn out to be less than the sweeping ones he pledged and instead become incremental, with promises do to more in a second term. That would be a problem when he seeks re-election.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News

Britain's struggle to bail out banks aggravated fresh soul-searching on transatlantic markets over the viability of leading US institutions without significant further public aid. A disclosure of huge potential losses at Boston-based State Street contributed to the rout. Bank of America, under pressure over its takeover of loss-making Merrill Lynch, saw its shares dive by 29%. JP Morgan dropped 21%, Citigroup lost 20%, Wells Fargo slid by 24% and Goldman Sachs fell 19%. It was the worst inauguration day in US history for stock prices according to figures compiled by Bloomberg and the Stock Traders' Almanac, with none of Washington's optimism spilling through to the financial sector. The new president's inaugural speech briefly lifted shares, although they tumbled downwards as the afternoon progressed. Obama reasserted his desire for tougher regulation, saying that the present crisis was a reminder that ""without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control"". Anxious traders compared the gathering sense of foreboding to the near panic which swept through markets in September in the weeks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. ""The market doesn't trust that banks have properly marked their balance sheets and their loan portfolios,"" said Robert Patten, a banking analyst at Morgan Keegan. ""The sense is that there are further marks to come, that tangible book [value] is not as it is stated today."" The money management firm State Street became the latest firm to be dragged into the mire as it revealed unrealised investment losses of $10bn on instruments such as commercial paper – short-term debt issued by companies. State Street, which has 28,000 staff worldwide, announced a 71% slump in quarterly profits to $65m and the company's shares dived by 59%. Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said investors were ""spooked"" by the 217-year-old firm's predicament: ""For State Street, this is the worst news we've ever seen in a day by far."" Standard &amp; Poor's cut its credit rating on State Street, which had hitherto been viewed as one of the healthier of America's major financial institutions. Underlining the severity of the change in market sentiment, the VIX index of volatility, known as Wall Street's ""fear index"", leapt by 22% to 56.39 – its highest since mid-December. The economist Nouriel Roubini, who was credited with foreseeing the present crisis, told a conference in Dubai that losses in the US financial system could hit $3.6tn before the credit crunch ends – which, he said, means the entire US banking system is effectively bankrupt. ""If that's true, it means the US banking system is effectively insolvent because it starts with a capital of $1.4tn,"" said Roubini. ""This is a systemic banking crisis.""",2009-01-20T21:34:16Z,News
45,obama,"The president needs our help Barack Obama is determined to make his promises a reality. But as he made it clear in his speech today, he cannot do it alone President Obama's inaugural speech was practical and philosophical, ambitious yet humble – a speech that paid homage to the past while also looking forward. Obama spent less time talking about the specific civil rights history that paved the way for his presidency than one might have expected, although he didn't really have to press the point: hearing and seeing an African American man taking the presidential oath, in addition to witnessing the millions of people of all races and nationalities who stood side by side in support of him was evidence enough of that. If anyone needed reminding though, the poignancy of the fact that ""a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before [us] to take a most sacred oath"" was not lost on anyone. Obama's references to change and hope – the themes that resonated so strongly with American voters during the campaign – were firmly grounded in the serious challenges that he and the country face as he steps into his new role. He is well aware that he has inherited a malfunctioning economy and destructive international conflicts which are yet to be resolved and that must be handled with extreme care. ""The challenges we face are real,"" he starkly warned. He seemed unafraid, however. Despite criticisms that his speech is lofty and his goals over-ambitious, his determination to make a reality of everything that he has promised is clear. He also made it clear during his speech, however, that he cannot do it alone. Most significantly, you see, underpinning President Obama's inaugural speech was a call to action to American people. ""For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies,"" the new president said. In every reference made to the past and in every plan and vision set out for the future, Obama emphasised his view that the progress of America and any forthcoming change is – and has always been – as much about the American people, the nature of American society and the values and ideals that underpin it as it is about the nation's government. For Obama this means a more responsible America, which as a nation has a less arrogant way of dealing with the world and doesn't take its greatness for granted or misuse its power. It goes without saying that there are many in the world – Obama talked specifically about the Muslim world in his speech – who will have been pleased to hear that and are looking forward to seeing America take that new approach, which is so markedly different from the aggressive ways of George Bush. This also means a more thoughtful and reflective American individual who will continue to ""take in a stranger when the levees break … and who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job."" Obama's campaign was built on people power and today he made it clear that it is that same power that will help lead America, under his presidency, become an even greater nation. He is also, unlike his predecessor whose legacy is considered to be overwhelmingly negative, deeply concerned about the America that will be left to future generations. The actions and attitudes of this generation matter to him and it is time for this generation of Americans to ""reaffirm [America's] enduring spirit; to choose our better history"". The generation that Obama has touched and impacted in such a monumental way during his campaign is the one that he now needs to continue in its desire for values-based action, and to also live a values-based life, in order to make significant progress. For the next four years, America – and the world – will watch Obama in action. Whether or not he is able to deliver the change he has promised and whether or not his actions will please the American people remains to be seen. The success of his presidency will be determined primarily by how he deals with the current circumstances that America finds itself in. However, as I stood in the crowd today, listening to Obama speaking, I heard a president who is thoughtful, reflective, conscious and aware while also pragmatic – ""the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works"" and grounded in reality. He knows it is whether or not his government works, and not just his words of inspiration, that will determine his success. This president told the world today that he is determined to ensure that both he, his team of officials and the people that he leads are different – and better – than that of the past. He wants to lead, and he wants Americans to work with him on that. This generation has as much responsibility in the future of America as the new government does. And that can only be a good thing.",2009-01-20T21:25:11Z,Opinion
46,obama,"Magical spell that will open a new American era  Today a magic spell will be performed. A man who 12 weeks ago was a mere political candidate will be transformed with the incantation of a few words, before a vast crowd and a television audience in the hundreds of millions if not billions, into the head of state, even the embodiment, of the most powerful nation on earth. It is an act of political alchemy that happens every time a new president is inaugurated, but rarely has the moment been as anticipated as this one. Washington DC, usually a city of strait-laced, sober-suited types has acquired the atmosphere of a child's bedroom in the first hours of Christmas morning. There are snow flurries outside, tacky decorations everywhere - and the resolve to wake up early, so as not to miss a moment of the great day. The excitement is intense and has been building for days, increasing with each coachload of newcomers that arrives in the city. Women wear woolly hats against the cold, the word OBAMA spelled out in diamante letters. Street-hawkers sell T-shirts bearing Obama's face, alongside ever more grandiose slogans. One shows a beatific president-to-be under the quasi-biblical declaration: ""And he shall be called Barack Obama."" The street merchandise, the nightly parties, the rare sighting of Hollywood A-listers among the policy wonks and thinktankers - that happens every four years. But no one would deny the extra fervour this time. The most obvious explanation is written on the faces of African-Americans who have travelled so far to be here. ""This moment won't come again,"" said Robert Davis, 63, who had travelled from Cincinnati, Ohio. ""There may be another black American president, but this will always be the first time."" He was part of the throng at the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, destination for many of those who have come to see Barack Obama sworn in. Perhaps it was a way to place their desire to witness history in a historical context - close to the monument to the president who ended slavery, the site where Martin Luther King declared his dream of equality. In this, the fates have once again helped endow Obama's inauguration with an epic quality. He accepted the Democratic party's presidential nomination on the 45th anniversary, to the day, of the ""I have a dream"" speech. Yesterday, the day before Obama's installation as president, was Martin Luther King day. It added to the sense that America will today reach some kind of fulfilment, even redemption. ""King's dream became a reality,"" said Davis, his voice wavering in the cold. But it is not only black America's pride in Obama that is lending extra magic to today's act of sorcery. For one thing, there is the sheer eagerness to see the back of the present incumbent, George W Bush, who marked a ""mostly private"" last day in office yesterday by granting a cluster of pardons and making a series of goodbye calls to world leaders. No president has left office with lower approval ratings. For another, it is the fact that today's inauguration ceremony will not need to deploy too much magical power to persuade Americans to see Barack Obama as their president. Proof of that is palpable in his dizzyingly high poll ratings, with 79% optimistic about the next four years, according to the New York Times, a degree of goodwill that trumps the numbers that greeted the previous five presidents. The same poll found high levels of hope among those who voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain. It's partly because he has, in the three months of transition, done much to reassure them, appointing solid, centrist figures, including more than one Republican, to key positions. Last night he was due to attend three private dinners honouring the public service of his vice-president-to-be, Joe Biden, and Republicans Colin Powell and McCain himself. But it's also because the new president does seem blessed with the poise and stature that befits a head of state. Yesterday he again looked the part, visiting wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed army medical centre, then rolling up his sleeves and helping paint the walls at a homeless shelter for teenagers in north-east Washington - with Martin Luther King's son at his side. Obama had urged his vast email database of supporters to follow his lead and engage in a day of community service. Among those heeding the call was Michelle Obama who, with her daughters, went to Washington's RFK stadium to join 15,000 volunteers in assembling ""care packages"" for US soldiers serving abroad. But, in a visit to the Calvin Coolidge high school, Obama said that this could not be a ""one-day affair"". He added: ""If we're waiting for someone else to do something, it never gets done."" That prefigures what is set to be one of Obama's major themes today: responsibility, the notion that government cannot solve America's vast problems alone, that everyone has to pitch in. That fits nicely with Obama's insistence that he will be able to work no miracles as president; that tackling the deepening economic crisis will be the stuff of long, hard work. The polls suggest Americans understand that. They know there will be no overnight fix. And they applaud their incoming president for saying so. Indeed, his caution and realism only make them admire him more. Such are the paradoxes of a man who insists he is no magician - but who will stand today at the centre of something magical.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
47,obama,"The making of a president Since the Democratic convention in 2000, when his accreditation 'barely granted him access to the men's room', Barack Obama has proved himself one of the great political orators, seamlessly combining complex argument with poignant personal reflection. As the world awaits today's inaugural address, Simon Schama introduces highlights of the new president's finest speechesRead the extracts from Obama's speeches:2002-2006 | 2006-Feb 2008 | Feb 2008-election night What is it about Illinois? Between Lincoln and Obama there was Everett Dirksen, US Senator in the 1950s and 60s whose LP of Great American Speeches was a fixture for the well-educated, historically minded middle-class library, where it sat alongside bound volumes of American Heritage magazine. Dirksen, Senate minority leader in the age of JFK and LBJ, was a combative conservative but he was not a bigot. It was he who corralled enough Republican votes to make Johnson's civil rights bills filibuster-proof in 1965. So in some sense, the Obama phenomenon, especially of mass voter mobilisation, owes something to his predecessor in the Senate. And the power of Dirksen was the power of voice: in his case, a deep, vibrating baritone that could, as he wanted, be as smooth as bourbon or as rough as a Chicago pothole in January. Rhetoric matters in the United States in ways hard to grasp in Britain, for all our vaunted relish of parliamentary debate. Churchill, our paragon of the inspirational voice, claimed he had learned the art of holding ""thousands in thrall"" from the County Sligo-born New York politician Bourke Cockrane in the 1890s. Phrases from American speeches have entered and lodged in the common culture - and not just from Lincoln and FDR but from the likes of William Jennings Bryan, who thundered about the gold standard that ""they shall not crucify us on a cross of gold"". Even those with only a faintly passing interest in history will know ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"" or ""ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country"". But while Churchill passes the memory test, who in Britain can remember anything from the speeches of those pantheonised as our great orators: Charles James Fox, Gladstone, Lloyd George, Bevan? Even so, the great surprise of the past campaign was Obama's resurrection of the power of the word. The electricity it generated, multiplied and amplified by the web, was not in conflict with the hard ground game of putting feet on the streets; but the fuel of mobilisation. There was a telling moment in the television debates when Hillary Clinton tried to characterise Obama as a glib but ultimately empty wordsmith beside her record of concrete. She was knowingly tapping into an old, rich tradition of suspicion against fancy highfalutin speechifying and anything smelling of the intellectual that runs through American democratic populism. But Obama neatly turned the moment against her by insisting that words were, in fact, deeds; and that at many critical junctures in American life - from the revolution through the civil war to the great depression - they had turned the tide from despair to resolution. It was not surprising, then, that at Sunday's public concert at the Lincoln Memorial, performances by Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger and Mary J Blige were interspersed with the words of Jefferson, Lincoln, JFK and Dr King. Obama's oratory resonates beyond the cultural classes in ways that, for example, Adlai Stevenson never managed, because it draws on so many taproots of public diction in the US. It is not clear how much his speechwriter Jon Favreau contributes to the text, but there is no doubt that it is the speaker himself who is responsible for its main lines of thought and its finished version. Obama can turn on the American Cicero as could Jefferson - and generations of high-school and college students who had to read manuals on public rhetoric written by the Scottish divine Hugh Blair. But he can also, without artifice, sound the great bell of black preaching-teaching that goes all the way back to Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists. When he wants, he can do unite-the-nation stentorian and, when it seems right, do street cool and a kind of honky-friendly hip-hop that goes down a treat. But none of this would work if he did not do that simplest thing: tell the truth. That was the essence of his greatest speech on the campaign at Philadelphia on 18 March, when facing a firestorm over the unhinged denunciations of his pastor Jeremiah Wright. He could have wriggled out of it, let it cool down, done something judicious. But he didn't. Instead, he grasped the burning stick and let things happen as they did. It added courageous decency to mere cleverness and it spoke of qualities that augur well for a leader in rough times.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
48,obama,"Tears and jeers in Tbilisi Even in Georgia's capital, there were few people mourning the end of George Bush's presidency High on a hillside above the Georgian capital, the lounge of the Hotel Betsy was hopping with a thrilled crowd of American expats. George Bush's favourite ex-Soviet capital with its exaggerated and now, as it seems, foolish hopes of joining Nato ought to have been a last redoubt of Rebublican loyalty as America played out its dignified transition. But here too, in the presence of the local head of USAid, numerous diplomats and non-governmental organisations' staff, the place was awash with tears of excitement as the inauguration unfolded on a large plasma screen. Cheers greeted the sight of Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn as they appeared on the west front of the Capital. The same for Bill and Hillary Clinton. Boos were launched at Dick Cheney as his wheelchair hove into view. ""Push him off the end of the pier"", shouted one voice. There were boos too for George Bush as he made his way down the steps of the Capitol on his own, ""abandoned by everyone including his wife"", said another voice. Silence fell during the swearing-in and the inaugural speech but gave way to cheers and toasts as America's new president finished his riveting address. Then the crowd rose as one to sing the Star-Spangled Banner. ""I hope I never see that fucker again"", said a woman who had worked in the Clinton administration as she watched Bush clamber into his helicopter. When the ex-President turned to wave, the crowd of several dozen Americans rose again and waved with a good deal more fervour than the departing Chief Executive. A US employee of the International Republican Institute, which conducts a ""democracy promotion"" programme in Georgia, was as delighted as any Democrat. Confessing to have voted for John McCain in spite of his being an ""asshole"", the official was thrilled to see Bush's departing back. It was a strong lesson for Georgians that patriotism can trump party loyalty. The room pulsated with pride at the way their country could conduct a peaceful and orderly transfer of power with such serenity, unlike Georgia's recent record of falsified elections and street demonstrations. For these Americans who have chosen to make their lives abroad, at least for a time, there was also a sense that they can hold their heads high again in the world beyond their shores. Beaming with delight, one man quoted the words Gerald Ford uttered after he took the oath after Nixon resigned in 1974: ""Our long national nightmare is over"". Or, as another put it graphically when he approached a stranger and discovered he was British, ""I think we are back. I apologise for the last eight years"".",2009-01-20T19:30:01Z,Opinion
49,obama,"Obama's historic inauguration lifts the fog over America  After eight years of arguably one of the world's most unpopular presidencies, I am relieved that George Bush's time in office has finally come to an end (Leaders, 17 January). He leaves behind a detestable legacy. His kneejerk reaction to the September 11 atrocity in 2001 has ensured that the world has become a more unstable and volatile place. His administration with its ""war on terror"" has caused thousands of innocent deaths in Afghanistan and continues to drown Iraq in a sea of innocent blood. As a consequence the Taliban has remerged more powerful and Iraq has been exposed to civil war. He has supported the torture of alleged Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. Domestically he leaves behind 40 million Americans without access to healthcare and an economy on the brink of collapse. In my opinion it was very fortunate only a pair of shoes was thrown at him. Seán Ó Floinn Weybridge, Surrey Bob Dylan's Masters of War raised my awareness in 1963. Now, it provides a suitable tribute to outgoing President Bush.

51,obama,"Hello, Mr President Barack Obama's inauguration offered moving oratory from our new president – and pompous blathering from everyone else When I first tune in to watch the morning's festivities, I am at least as excited, if not more so, that this is George Bush's last day as president as I am that it is Barack Obama's first. It is, however, mere moments before footage of the crowd – that amazing, breathtaking crowd – makes me giddy with anticipation and disinclined to look backward, no matter how thrilled to see the back of Bush I am. And oh how thrilled I am. But before I can toast my new president, I've got hours of the usual cable shenanigans through which to sit. MSNBC is the usual mix of absurdity and unexamined privilege, as Chris Matthews compares the Bushes to the Romanovs (starring Miss Beazley as Anastasia!) and Keith Olbermann says they're so far away that Obama will ""look like a raisin"". CNN is predictably boring with their ""facts"" and ""restraint"", so I head back to MSNBC, where Matthews waxes global, informing me that the US is not as monarchical as outsiders think. Why, just recently US supreme court chief justice John Roberts's wife was standing next to him at the cobbler's! I switch to Fox News. It's just a test pattern accompanied by audio of Sean Hannity quietly sobbing. Back to MSNBC, where Matthews is now rhapsodising about the concept of democracy, telling me there is a sense in America that, ""on some level"", all people are equal. This note is followed immediately by images of Dan Quayle entering the inauguration with Al Gore right behind him, and I think: Yes, Matthews is right. You can be a rich, white, idiot dude or a rich, white, genius dude and become vice-president. Go equality! Maude bless the USA. When Bush appears moments later, he is booed. Highly inappropriate, wildly disrespectful and, of course, totally hilarious. Dick Cheney is wheeled in, owing to a pulled muscle from moving boxes, presumably to a giant shredding truck parked in front of his residence. On nearly all the news coverage, there is some comment about how almost anticlimactic, or, perhaps more accurately, anachronistic this inaugural seems. Between Bush having checked out of the job about two years ago, the election having lasted two years and Obama having given a third as many press conferences since being elected as Bush gave in eight years, the introduction of Obama as president seems somehow incongruous to those paying intimate attention. Still, it's clearly inauguration day, as evidenced by the fearsome spinning in the graves of Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms, George Wallace, Orval Faubus, Fielding Wright and other famous elder statesmen-racists. Back at the inaugural, Pastor Rick Warren delivers an overtly Christian invocation to the collective chagrin of progressives, including every progressive Christian I know. He refers to the proceedings as ""the peaceful transfer of power for the 44th time"". Sure it is. Inherent math problem aside, tell that to Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, buddy. When Obama arrives, he is the picture of cool calm collectedness, and only looks nervous for the first time during the oath. And then it is done – and we have a new president. Barack Hussein Obama gives his first speech as our president, and its every word and every beautiful turn of phrase appeals to our better natures. It implores us to service, to sacrifice, to shared responsibility. It asks for our imagination and our participation. It says, in each idea, each exhortation, each question, each sentence: I am a uniter, not a divider. And on this day, listening to a man who is American and African, black and white, privileged and subjugated, sceptical and hopeful, abandoned son and present father, fresh-faced and graying at his temples, I give myself a moment to believe the possibility that he really is. The Rev Joseph Lowery gives the benediction, during which he asks that we all ""make choices on the side of love not hate, on the side of inclusion not exclusion, tolerance not intolerance,"" as if to underline the point – and simultaneously remind us all that our new president has occasionally fallen far short of that mark himself. Former President Bush flies away for the last time in Marine One, to a chorus of voices singing ""Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye"". Keith Olbermann pompously quotes Shakespeare. Chris Matthews says something tragic about Kennedy's fedora. And suddenly it's just another day in Washington again.",2009-01-20T18:04:52Z,Opinion
52,obama,"Towards the enlightened middle To quell the simmering discontent between the US and Muslims, Obama must embrace diplomacy and foster respectful dialogue On inauguration day, Muslims and citizens worldwide will optimistically and anxiously begin purging the sordid memory of the disastrous and obtuse arrogance of the Bush administration. Even Barack Obama cannot completely cleanse the collective stain of the Bush era that squandered global goodwill with two failed wars, a belligerent rhetoric of a clash of civilisations, unyielding support for Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and the shameful, morally indefensible legacies of Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. To quell the simmering discontent and unrest between the United States and Muslims, Barack Obama – the appointed Superman of the 21st century's globalised, multicultural world – can flex his powers and demonstrate heroism by embracing diplomacy, renouncing hypocritical and selfish policy initiatives and spearheading a dialogue fuelled by respect and mutual understanding. ""A president can set a tone for a nation. President Bush used fear to further his policies. President Obama will hopefully set a tone of tolerance and inclusiveness,"" suggests Dean Obeidallah, an award-winning Arab-American comedian who has travelled across the Middle East, echoing the sentiments of many Muslims and Arabs worldwide. However, buyer's remorse seems to have set in for many Muslims following the usually verbose and eloquent Obama's unusual silence concerning Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza that has killed over 900 Palestinians and wounded nearly 4,000 more. Obama's reluctance to vocally condemn Israel's punishing militarism against Palestinians has forced many Muslims to believe he will be a Manchurian candidate instead of a superhero; a mere parrot who recycles the ineffective ""support Israel above all else"" narrative to the detriment of brokering a tangible peace process that includes the Palestinians as viable partners. As Jamal El-shayyal, a Middle East expert and producer for Aljazeera, told me: ""The Egyptian public like the rest of the Arab world is not too optimistic for a change in policy during the Obama administration … the majority of people do not regard US foreign policy with the slightest respect. Many view it as biased, oppressive and at times even inhumane."" Dealing fairly with the citizens of Palestine serves as the ideal template for Obama to prove that his eloquent rhetoric of change was not just a politically savvy, Machiavellian ruse. Currently, however, the US is predictably staying on its antiquated course by emerging as the only UN security council member who abstained from voting on a resolution expressing ""grave concern"" about the growing humanitarian crisis and heavy civilian casualties in Gaza. At Aipac's annual conference last summer, Obama followed suit by promising he would ""never compromise when it comes to Israel's security"". Meanwhile, incoming secretary of state Clinton affirmed ""the United States stands with Israel now and forever"". Obama's new government can continue to ignore the concerns of Palestinians and instead unconditionally defend Israel to ensure purely selfish US and Israeli policy initiatives, but at what cost? Dr Hatem Bazian, an adjunct professor at the Boalt School of Law and lecturer at the University of California Berkeley, predicted the logical, dire consequence of such a myopic policy: ""If the US under Obama does not move swiftly to change course and address the need for a real peace in Palestine for representative democratic political process in corrupt and autocratic regimes then the next conflicts will be more bloody and far more destructive than what we are witnessing today."" Hosni Mubarak's repressive and stifling dictatorship in Egypt, which is strongly supported by the United States but reviled by Egyptians, is increasingly threatened by the emergence of hard-line, Islamic governments such as Hamas. Its success emboldens Mubarak's rivals, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, a popular Muslim political and social organisation and major opposition to Mubarak's rule. As a close US ally, Mubarak closed Egypt's borders to fleeing Gaza refugees and offered a harsh rebuke to Hamas for firing Qassam rockets despite criticisms of such rhetoric by angry Egyptians. If Obama indeed practices the diplomacy he preaches and wants to eschew America's mantle of selfish hypocrisy, he must at the very least interact with democratically elected Muslim governments and representatives, like Hamas and Ahmadinejad of Iran, especially considering the US has no problem aligning itself closely with the oppressive regime in Mubarak's Egypt and Saudi Arabia. However, it bears noting that not all Islamic oriented governments are radical or hard-line reactionaries, as seen in Turkey and Indonesia. Thus a wholesale demonisation and rejection of Islamic based governments and political groups is an affront to the Muslims who elected them, a perpetuation of Bush's ""clash of civilisation"" rhetoric seeped in religious and racial intolerance, and ultimately a diplomatic hindrance that sours and corrupts a relationship that could have flourished as a beneficial alliance in the war on terror. Also, it must be noted that the Muslim world, both in America and abroad, is not a monolithic Borg entity that can be easily demarcated between enraged fundamentalists and secular modernists. Furthermore, many Muslims, just like Americans, appreciate the complexities and nuances of global politics and foreign diplomacy. Willow Wilson, a Muslim essayist and comic book author who has lived in Egypt, agrees: ""To me, the 'clash of civilisations' never seemed as dire in the Muslim world as it is here [in America]. With the exception of extremists, people in the Muslim Middle East seem quite willing to separate Americans from their government."" Ultimately, the perceived hypocrisy of US foreign policy with the Muslim world – in stark contrast to its espoused democratic ideals and values – must be radically altered by Obama's rhetoric and initiatives. As Dalia Mogahed, the director of the Gallup Centre for Muslim Studies and co-author of the indispensable Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think, told me after years of polling Muslims worldwide: ""Muslims admire what we call 'western values' of equality and human rights, but do not believe that we as [Americans] live these values in our treatment of them. … To regain trust, America must project an image, through its actions, consistent with its promise to the world."" From this perspective, the Muslim world has been intently watching how Obama – and by extension America – treats its very own Muslim-American citizens. Despite record voter turnout and a highly organised, proactive civic engagement during the election, many Muslim-Americans feel spurned by Obama as if they were political kryptonite or modern day Boo Radleys. This is also evidenced by a national hysteria whose fear of Muslims forced AirTran to remove innocent Muslim-American patrons from their airplane. Despite the FBI giving security clearance to the Muslim-American family and vouching for their normalcy, they were removed to placate the misplaced paranoia of a few passengers. To make matters worse, Obama, unlike George Bush, refused to visit a mosque during his presidential campaign so the taint of Muslim would not dare rub off on him. (At the time, 13% of Americans were convinced Obama was an undercover Muslim and thus perceived him negatively.) His staff also ignominiously removed two visible hijabi (veiled) Muslim women from the stands so they would not appear on camera. Even the architect of two major Iraq wars, Colin Powell, strenuously denounced the rampant fear mongering and unwarranted questioning of Muslim Americans and their alleged loyalty and patriotism to the United States. However, Obama – or any ranking Democrat for that matter – has yet to publicly denounce such divisionary and bigoted rhetoric. Obama could have – and should have – mentioned Arabs and Muslims in his victory speech especially considering he stressed inclusiveness and respect for diversity among straights and gays, blacks and whites, abled and disabled. Would a mention of Muslims, Arabs and Jews not help tremendously in bridging the divides? However, Obama can redeem this oversight through his historic inauguration speech. Such inviting rhetoric shows Muslims at home and abroad that Obama's generation seek dialogue in which both parties reach across the table to shake hands and finally talk to one another instead of at one another. As Ms Mogahed told me: ""More than anything, Muslims want to be respected as equal human beings; neither parented or demonised by the west. Obama must make Muslims feel that they are partners, not subjects or suspects, in the challenges facing our world."" The clash of civilisations might be paved with extremism, intolerance and reckless aggression, but the road to moderation is a two way dialogue traversed with sincerity, mutual respect and desire for change through understanding. Let's hope Obama and Muslims both begin their walk and meet each other somewhere in the enlightened middle.",2009-01-20T13:00:01Z,Opinion
53,obama,"'Yes we did!' Witnesses to history delighted as new era begins At Washington's National Mall, Obama supporters welcome their new president – but have only boos for George Bush The sound of the first cannon shot heralding the beginning of the Barack Obama era was still travelling over the human sea that had poured into the Mall when the call went out from a man in a woolly red hat. ""We have a real president,"" he cheered. Then out of habit or reflex, the people around him began to chant the Obama anthem of these last two years: ""Yes we can, yes we can,"" until someone remembered the candidate was now the president. ""Yes, we did,"" someone yelled, and there was a hush as those around him took it in: Obama, once the unlikeliest of candidates, was now the president. ""Yes, we did,"" said a woman in an ankle-length fur with tears in her eyes. ""Amen."" For the multitudes who occupied the grounds west of the Capitol to the Washington Monument, today was an occasion of solemnity as well as celebration. People shared snacks and hand warmers, and offered extravagant apologies for grazing other bodies. Any jostling for a better sight line to Obama – a tiny dark figure on a building of blinding whiteness under the winter sun from this vantage point – was looked on with disapproval. ""That's not in the keeping of the spirit of the day,"" chided one woman. But there were also some hungering for retribution. When the arrival of Laura Bush was announced, there was a delay before a dutiful smattering of applause from the VIP seats. When her husband turned up, there was a cascade of boos. ""Impeach him,"" someone yelled as the orchestra began Hail to the Chief. From above the Mall came a reprise of the songs that protesters had sung outside the White House on election night: ""Sha na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye."" ""Oh stop,"" said Elizabeth Stoehr, a sculptor from Cincinnati who had been a campaign volunteer during the election. ""We're close enough to the end,"" she said. ""He's moving on. Let him finish it in peace."" Behind her, a woman booed again, and yelled: ""I love it."" The reaction to George Bush notwithstanding, this was a crowd with enormous reservoirs of goodwill, as well as fortitude. It was for many thousands an act of immense determination just to get to the Mall. By 6am, still before sunrise, the parking lots at the outermost ends of the Metro line were full, and the first spectators had made their way past the checkpoints and crowd-control barriers onto the Mall. Above ground, the city streets were taken over by a steady flood of people all bound for the Mall. Below, in the Metro lines running to the Mall, packed trains inched along towards the Capitol, their progress halted by the build-up of earlier trains. By 8am the nearest Metro stations to the Capitol had shut down, or given up collecting fares. But it still took 30 minutes for passengers to make their way from train platforms through the tunnels and climb up to daylight. As they waited underground in the dimly lit station, the chants went out again: ""O-bam-a"" and ""Yes, we can"". There were more queues – and more confusion – to come as the multitudes trudged towards the entry points to the Mall. ""This is like giving birth, squeezing everyone through a little hole, and we are the baby,"" grumbled Willie Blount, who works on IT in Congress. But despite their determination, and a good-natured tone, many turned back before they even reached the checkpoints, defeated by the long lines and the cold. A few, who had squeezed with the crowds through the narrow entrance to be disgorged on the lawns west of the Capitol, wondered whether it had been worth it. ""I'm going to have to go home on watch this on YouTube,"" said a 14-year-old girl from Connecticut who had got up at 5am to see Obama being sworn in. But they were the few. For the many on the Mall, the crowds, the extreme weather, and the security all soon receded against the momentousness of the occasion. Katie B Catalon, the president of the National Beauty Culturalists League, said: ""For me to see this promise fulfilled, not just of Martin Luther King, but of all our forbears in the civil rights movement, to me, this is the epitome of hope.""",2009-01-20T18:57:26Z,News
54,obama,"Labour MP blames Tories for disrupting broadcast of Barack Obama's speech  MPs who were hoping to watch the whole of Barack Obama's inauguration speech live were interrupted when the division bell went off just after the new president started speaking.

The ever-creative Denis MacShane, the Labour former foreign minister, has just put out a press release claiming that this amounts to a Tory snub to the new leader of the free world. I was saddened to leave Mr Obama's world historic speech in order to feed Conservative isolationism by voting in a division on a vote to take note of European Union policy on the financial crisis. There was no decision impacting on UK law or government decisions but the Tories are so obsessed against Europe they called a division just after Mr Obama had begin his speech.

55,obama,"Jubilation and resignation as world reacts to arrival of new US president Citizens from Africa to the Middle East explain how they think Barack Obama's presidency will affect the planet's hotspots Saeed Kamali Dehghan in Tehran Barack Obama took office amid fevered speculation that the moderate former president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, was to announce his candidacy for Iran's upcoming presidential elections. Khatami told aides that he would announce his decision in the next few days, local Iranian news agencies reported. With the prospect of a renewed Khatami presidency, thousands of Iranians who were watching the inauguration ceremony via their illegal satellite dishes were given a glimmer of hope that three decades of Iran-US hostility might be about to end. Hamed Mohaghegh, 21, an industrial civil engineering student in Tehran, watching the ceremony on the BBC, said that the US had given its democracy a boost by electing an black man as president. ""Before Obama was elected, we had this impression in our country that a black man will never succeed to become the president of the States, a candidate who had an Arabic middle name, Hussein."" ""[Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad [the Iranian president] has also doubted, saying that he thinks that [American voters would] not let a black man become the president of the US,"" said Reza Ahmadi, 40, an Iranian maths teacher at a high school. Yet, others were disappointed that Obama had not responded to the letter of congratulation sent to him by Ahmadinejad. ""It seems that the whole world has a share of Obama's 'change that can happen' except Iranian people"", he added. Ali Mohammadi, 37, an Iranian businessman, thinks that bringing Obama on to the US political stage was the only choice Americans had. ""America is not popular and powerful as before; the US is rather notorious for its background in Iraq and Afghanistan right now and is facing an economic crisis, so Obama was the only one to stabilise the States not only economically but also to get back the US ex-reputation in the world,"" he said. Media Kashigar, 52, a well-known Iranian intellectual and critic, believes that US foreign policy toward Iran has not changed in at least the past 30 years. ""Iran-US conflict is not a governmental or administrational problem. It is a mutual state problem, so I think neither Obama nor anyone else in Iran can ease the debate easily in [the near] future,"" he said. ""I don't think the US president has much influence to change American foreign policy. We've experienced JF Kennedy, we've seen Clinton and Bush, but has there been any foreign policy apparent change in [the] past 60 years in the US?"" said Amirmehdi Rezaee, 60, an Iranian retired-employee of the country's government. Xan Rice in Kisumu ""I'm tingling like I'm in a sauna,"" said Samson Wakoli, a 26-year-old bank worker, as he watched Obama's speech with thousands of other Kenyans tonight on a giant screen near the shores of Lake Victoria. ""This gives me strength. We have waited so long. God is good, God is good, God is good."" As Bob Marley's One Love began to play, Ruth Odaga said she had been ""touched in a very special way"". ""Last January we were fighting here"" – the town of Kisumu was badly hit in Kenya's post-election violence – ""and now look at the happiness Obama has given everyone,"" she said. Celebrations were already in full swing across the country that includes ""the small village where my father was born"" that Obama referred to in his speech. In nearby Kogelo, where Obama Sr grew up, the party was at Barack Obama primary school, where classrooms had become makeshift hotels with names like Something Cold and Connie of Siaya. ""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old teacher. ""He is our son."" Male dancers wearing short pink-and-blue sisal skirts, feathers strapped to their arms and the occasional cloak made from the silky black and white fur of a colobus monkey, entertained the crowd. Hawkers sold T-shirts, calendars and traditional print wraps. A photographer was selling framed portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is from this region. George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study at the adjacent secondary school, said: ""By becoming US president, Obama has given us all hope. If you believe something then you can do it."" Back at the sports ground in Kisumu, a young boy, perhaps eight years old, danced along to the music, telling anyone who would listen: ""I'm the next Barack Obama, OK?"" Luke Harding in Moscow Obama's inauguration provoked a lukewarm response in Russia, with state television covering the event patchily, and the only public displays of attention breaking out in overtly expatriate venues. ""I don't think the relationship between our countries will change greatly,"" Igor Krasavin, 28, a philosophy lecturer from Yekaterinburg, predicted after the speech. He added, however: ""Personally, I like him."" Most Russians appear to agree – praising his ""powerful"" delivery but also noting he looked a bit nervous, especially at the beginning. They were generally optimistic that Obama would now bring positive changes, though. ""I expect him to practise a greener kind of politics,"" Konstantin Zgurovsky, a 56-year-old ecologist, said. ""I think he will pay greater attention to domestic problems and pull the US army out of Iraq."" Others were more equivocal. ""Unquestionably there will be changes. But what they are we still don't know yet. I hope he quickly resolves the US's crisis, so that Russia's economic problems become easier,"" Tatyana Bazlova, 27, from Pskov said. There was also general agreement that the 44th president could only be an improvement on the disastrous 43rd; George Bush is seen in Russia, as elsewhere, as a warmonger. Obama's speech was seen by many as a direct repudiation of the Bush legacy. ""I hope that Obama means that Russia and the US develop a pragmatic partnership. I hope Obama prefers to use his intelligence rather than war as a means of influence,"" Alena Pravidla, 31, from Moscow said. Martin Chulov in Baghdad Many Iraqis seemed nonplussed at the swearing-in of Obama, with some not knowing the inauguration was taking place and others consumed by the fall-out from the outgoing presidency. Obama's messages of change and remaking America have yet to resonate in the country that will help shape the legacy of his first years in office. Some Baghdadis, however, were impressed by his inauguration speech. ""If he can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over,"" said Abu Ali, the owner of a sparkling new restaurant, Shisha Cafe, in the city's Karada district. ""I believe he is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests,"" he added. ""That's it."" Another cafe-goer, Haitham Sarkis, said that his family had long ago stopped listening to Bush and become dispirited by his last three years in office. ""He kept telling us one thing, yet we were living the other,"" he said. ""This man never knew us and we are left with a massive mess that we must now pick up, not the new president."" The US presence on the streets of Baghdad may be slowly diminishing, but the withdrawal of the occupying forces is not generating a rise in America's popularity. Iraqi children and youths regularly taunt each other by removing their shoes and threatening to throw them – mimicking the local journalist who humiliated Bush during his last visit in December. ""Obama won't get the same treatment,"" said a nurse from the northern suburb of Adamiyeh, Um Nassir. ""But he won't have too long to prove himself to us."" Bush, however, is not a villain to all. ""He always said history will judge him,"" said Samira Musawi, a parliamentarian. ""But God will judge him as well and God has used Bush to remove the evil of Saddam and set the Iraqi nation free. It is now our responsibility to find the right way to direct this change."" Rory Carroll in Caracas Obama spoke of a world remade but Luis Fernando's Caracas slum did not look any different and he saw little reason to think US policy towards Hugo Chávez and Latin America would be any different. The 50-year-old security guard watched the inauguration speech dubbed into Spanish on a flickery TV and shrugged. ""Seems to me he is going to be just like the other one, Bush. He hasn't even started yet and he's already making threats against us."" Fernando, from El Valle, a hillside of precarious shacks in Venezuela's capital, supports Chávez's socialist revolution and is suspicious of the superpower. ""It's good that a man of colour is in the White House; he may show solidarity with Latin America."" But the self-proclaimed ""Chavista"" echoed his beloved president in suspecting that as surely as a tropical sun shone overhead Washington would stir trouble. Chávez reaped acclaim for standing up to Bush, who backed a failed coup against him in 2002 before going on to invade Iraq. The oil-rich leader cast his revolution as a beacon in the fight against imperialism and claimed Venezuela was next in the Pentagon's sights. The rhetoric galvanised his red-clad supporters and tarred opponents as CIA stooges. The ascent of a black US president who opposed the Iraq war has presented Chávez, who revels in confrontation, with a dilemma. He initially celebrated Obama's election but recently said Obama shared Bush's ""stench"" and was trying to destabilise Venezuela. State media echoed that today with warnings that Obama would be hostage to US corporate and military interests. ""We don't have many illusions; he has already started baring his teeth against Venezuela,"" said the newspaper Diario Vea. Fernando gazed at the TV images of cannons firing in salute and sighed. ""Let's give Obama a chance. Give him some time and see what he does."" Rory McCarthy in Gaza City In the Popeye Cafe in Gaza City, dozens of young Palestinians sat in front of the television drinking tea and smoking water-pipes tonight, but, though they glanced up at Obama's speech occasionally, very few believe the new US president will make any difference to their lives. ""I have a feeling deep inside me that we shouldn't expect anything from Obama,"" said Taher Yazji, 24, whose family runs a printing business. ""All of them speak of the Middle East as a priority but we don't see anything from them, no results at all. I don't think the ordinary people of America understand what has happened to us. I don't think that anyone looks at the Palestinians. We're just trying to defend our homeland in the same way they defend their homeland."" Ask a Gazan what they would like to see from a US president, what would change their lives for the better, and they all give the same answer: lift the long and painful economic blockade that Israel has imposed on this small, overcrowded territory of 1.5 million people. That blockade remains in place even after three weeks of war which claimed 1,360 Palestinian and 13 Israeli lives. Masood Samouni, 22, sat upstairs at the cafe. Two weeks ago he lost his sister, two aunts and many more relatives when the Israeli forces shelled their homes in Zeitoun, on the southern outskirts of Gaza. ""I just came out to try and forget some of the bad memories,"" he said. He was dressed in his friend's clothes and hasn't yet had the courage to go home. ""I know the American people are optimistic about Obama and I do believe that some of them understand our situation and show solidarity with us. But we're being squeezed here. We just want to feel safe and secure. I hope the new president will make a change and put pressure on Israel and Egypt to let them open the crossings and let us go abroad and live our lives."" His friend, Salah Khalifa, 22, a student of business administration, said: ""We hope he'll make a change. I'm optimistic because we need a solution for the Palestinian issue."" Ahmed Yazji, 29, one of the waiters, stopped to watch the speech translated into Arabic on the al-Arabiya television channel but said he expected nothing new. ""We are here defending our rights and no one understands,"" he said. ""And if anyone says they really understand then they risk being killed – look what happened to Rabin."" Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister, was assassinated by a Jewish rightwing extremist in 1995 after signing the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians. ""This conflict will last until the end of time,"" said Yazji.",2009-01-20T18:45:11Z,News
56,obama,"Frederick Douglass paved Obama's way The US and UK have a special relationship. Barack Obama should remember Britain's role in transforming one of his heroes With the US's inauguration of its first African-American president today, you couldn't blame British officials for fretting about future relations between our two countries. As revealed last month, British colonial forces tortured Barack Obama's grandfather – a veteran of the second world war – during the fight for Kenyan independence and also arrested his father, Barack Obama Sr. Not surprisingly, then, Obama Jr has little good to say about Britain in his memoir, Dreams From My Father. In fact, aside from the founding fathers, it's hard to think of a US president with better reasons for holding a personal grudge against America's mother country. In hard times though, America and Britain tend to look to each other as old allies, and Gordon Brown (or his Tory pretender) could remind the new president just how special our relationship is by focusing on an oft-forgotten event from our shared past: Britain's role in not just freeing – but also transforming – one of Obama's heroes into a world champion of human rights. Though little known in the UK nowadays, Frederick Douglass is still famous in the US for his compelling life story. As a runaway slave, he turned himself into arguably the most eloquent opponent of slavery in the run-up to the civil war, an enduring role model whose words have resounded through the speeches of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and the new US president himself. Obama's former students at the University of Chicago remember him citing Douglass's ability to express high-minded ideals in down-to-earth language, while encompassing the views of both black and white Americans. ""No one speaks this way anymore,"" he told them. But few Americans realise that it was actually Britain that made Douglass. Indeed, he admired the British (especially the Scots) so much that he changed his surname from Bailey to Douglass in honour of a regal fugitive in the work of Sir Walter Scott. And he would have been immensely gratified to see America's first black president sworn in the same week as the 250th anniversary of his beloved ploughman poet, Robert Burns. Barely three years after escaping to the north, Douglass began denouncing the firsthand horrors of slavery under his assumed name – but he was so well spoken that his enemies accused him of being a fake. To silence them, he decided to disclose his owner's details in his Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, which (like Obama's memoir) became a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic. Having blown his own cover, though, Douglass was no longer safe. His owner could legally have him captured anywhere in the United States. So Douglass's allies arranged for the 28-year-old to go on a lecture tour of Great Britain starting in August 1845. ""Thus I was led to seek a refuge in monarchical England from the dangers of republican slavery,"" he wrote, noting that his journey also marked a reversal of the old slave-trade route: whereas many Africans had been exported to the Americas via Britain, he was a runaway slave seeking freedom from US justice in the UK. The reason for coming here was simple: Britain had outlawed slavery 12 years earlier, and as the source of US civilisation, Douglass and his fellow abolitionists hoped that Britain could use its ""moral force"" over the American elite. ""You have an influence on America that no other nation can have,"" he declared at his reception speech in London. In just 19 months, Douglass got to know the British Isles better than many Americans before or since, delivering more than 300 speeches in virtually every major town and city in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. But he also came here to perfect his speechmaking skills. ""Although Americans are generally better speakers than Englishmen,"" one of his compatriots told him, ""you will find in England individual orators superior to the best of ours."" Douglass got to see Disraeli and Peel in action, and he particularly admired the Irish Emancipator, Daniel O'Connell: ""His eloquence came down upon the vast assembly like a summer thundershower upon a dusty road."" For his part, Douglass also made an impression on his hosts. Tall, muscular, and respectful to a fault, he proved particularly popular with female Nonconformists – not least because he was an early advocate of women's rights. It was a couple of Quaker sisters from Newcastle who insisted on raising the funds to buy his freedom from his American master for £150 (roughly £10,000 today). ""Humane British men and women bought my body and bones with British gold, and made me a present to myself,"" Douglass said. ""I thank God that there is at least one Christian country on this globe where a coloured man may rest secure from the fury and vengeance of alarmed and terrified slaveholders."" Douglass's British supporters also offered to bring his wife and children over so they could live permanently in the UK. Instead, Douglass asked for funds to start his own African-American newspaper in the US – a move discouraged by his white American allies, who warned that previous attempts to found a black-owned paper had failed. Backed by his British sympathisers, though, Douglass's North Star would end up proving his American doubters wrong. Douglass finished his speaking tour of Britain in April 1847. ""I have here, for the first time in my life, known what it was to enjoy liberty,"" he said during his farewell speech in London. ""I go back to the United States not as I landed here – I came a slave; I go back a free man. I came here a thing – I go back a human being. I came here despised and maligned – I go back with reputation and celebrity."" ""Wherever I have gone, I have been treated with the utmost kindness, with the greatest deference, the most assiduous attention; and I have every reason to love England. … Wherever else I may be a stranger, in England I am at home."" Douglass was forced to seek refuge in Britain once more ahead of the civil war, having been falsely implicated in an attempt to start an armed slave revolt in October 1859. However, he soon returned to the states and went on to advise Abraham Lincoln during the war. He later became the first African-American to be nominated as vice-president, on a fringe-party ticket with America's first female presidential candidate in 1872. Douglass never did accept the nomination, though. He was too busy campaigning for Ulysses S Grant, who, like Lincoln (but unlike Obama) was actually a Republican. To quote Douglass's favourite verse by Burns, regardless of political colours, ""a man's a man for all that"".",2009-01-20T15:00:00Z,Opinion
57,obama,"A motto for the people What does Obama have in common with first-century rabbis? An understanding of the power of words What do most people in this country – perhaps in the United States too – associate with Barack Obama ? It is not so much a detailed understanding of his policies, but a general feel about him offering promise and hope. It is summed up in the phrase that punctuated so many of his speeches: ""Yes we can"". Was it simply a campaign motto or was it something more? Positive and forward-looking, it goes beyond simple politics and has a religious resonance to it. It is not that political life cannot be positive and forward-looking, but that Obama seemed to be tapping into something beyond the immediate economic agenda and more connected with our long-term human potential. We want to believe that we can each make a difference; that we can have an effect on the world; that our lives are not in vain; that our existence is worthwhile; that the world can be a better place; that the current version of it does not have to be the final version; that in our own small way we count and have significance. There is a messianic quality about Obama's slogan that reminds me of various utterances by the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. It is close in its spirit of optimism to the political platform of Amos, who declared: ""Let justice run down like water and righteousness as an everlasting stream."" (5:24) Perhaps the most famous and influential biblical catchphrase belongs to Moses. His demand of Pharoah to ""Let my people go"" has reverberated down the centuries and across the world. It has been used by slaves in Mississippi, Baptists in the former Soviet Union and black people in Soweto. Incidentally, in Hebrew ""Let my people go"" is only three words (""shallach et ami"") – proof that, like Obama's three-word phrase, keeping it short can be effective and memorable. There are also two bon mots from rabbis of the first century, which embody a philosophy of positive action similar to the Obama manifesto. Hillel said ""If am not for myself, who is for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?"" It is a wonderfully succinct summary of the balance between protecting one's own rights and needs, yet also caring for those of others. But the punchline is the third sentence (""And if not now, when?""): it is not enough to theorise about it or make bold statements; what counts is going out and making it happen. Equally powerful is the motto of his younger colleague, Rabbi Tarfon, who said: ""It is not your duty to finish the work but neither are you free to neglect it"". It gives impetus to all those who see a massive task, be it eradicating typhoid or saving the environment, despair that they cannot solve it by themselves, but need to be part of the ongoing process that, over time and with the input of others, will eventually prove successful. The words of Hillel and Tarfon indicate the real greatness of Obama's phrase; it crossed over from being yet another clever soundbite into being a deep personal motto. Perhaps the best way to respond to ""Yes we can"" is not just to admire it, but to formulate a saying of our own that can help guide our personal lives and whose values we can bring into family and work situations. There is no reason why mottoes should only be for those who have a coat of arms to their name. Obama has reminded us of the power of inspiring words. It shows the influence he is having even before he has spent a day in office.",2009-01-20T11:00:11Z,Opinion
58,obama,"Obama's message to the Middle East In Jordan, Obama's inaugural message of hope to the Muslim world is overshadowed by the Gaza conflict Watching Barack Obama's inauguration on television in Amman, Jordan, as he stumbled over his words during the oath, then spoke eloquently of Americans now choosing ""our better history"", I wanted to celebrate, like many, as we did in November. After the election, the change of mood in the normally subdued Jordanian capital was palpable. Everybody wanted to talk about Obama, and, with Tzipi Livni still a largely unknown figure here, there was genuine hope among many that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process would finally make the progress the Bush-Blair era made much noise about but never delivered. The sense of goodwill toward Obama also stemmed from optimism that, after eight disastrous years of Bush-Cheney foreign policy, Iraq might finally begin to heal and Guantanamo Bay might finally be closed. Troops out of Iraq means much to the estimated 500,000 Iraqis currently living in refugee camps in Jordan, many with little access to housing and education. Every conversation operated on the same three points: Obama, Iraq and hope. Today, however, the mood couldn't be more different, and the word that most often follows Obama's name in conversation is not ""Iraq"" but ""Gaza"". ""Hope"" is probably the last idea that would accompany it. The aerial bombardment and later ground invasion of the Gaza Strip over the last three weeks has changed everything, and few people here watched the build-up to the inauguration. While CNN is spending 48 hours in ceaseless coverage of events in Washington, reporting the great narrative of American political change, the focus of Arab news networks and of people in the Middle East is still largely on Gaza – the dead and the tens of thousands now homeless. Every Middle Easterner knows who Livni is now, and Obama is now often currently seen as the good man who did nothing – who, his difficult position during the transition period acknowledged, nonetheless frustrated many by barely speaking out while some 1,300 Gazans were killed by one of America's closest allies. Around half of Jordan's population is of recent Palestinian descent, and Gaza is less than 100 miles from Amman. But the geographic proximity felt increasingly like a bad joke or a mind trick, as the already-blockaded Strip became increasingly sealed under siege, and Jordanian-Palestinians were left unable to contact their families and friends on the other side of Israel. Obama encouraged Americans to spend this year's Martin Luther King day volunteering for their communities. Over the past three weeks here, Jordanians, Palestinians and others bought food and medical supplies and organised dozens of fundraisers for international charities working in Gaza. The Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation was overwhelmed by donations from ordinary people of canned food and medical supplies for UNRWA aid convoys, an initiative which suffered a setback on January 8 when UNRWA seemed about to leave Gaza when the its aid convoy was hit. Al Jazeera, the only television news network with a presence in Gaza during the military offensive, provided a constant (and eventually, perhaps, unhelpful) stream of graphic images of the dead and wounded civilians in Gaza. American networks seemed content to represent the feeling of the region solely through reporting Muslim Brotherhood-backed protests in the Middle East, replete with iconic stereotypes of flag-burning and violent threats – and there's no denying that the Gaza attack brought every odious, antisemitic Islamist spokesperson out of the woodwork. But many more ordinary Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese participated in far-less-newsworthy efforts such as blood drives to help the injured in Gaza. With the tentative ceasefire now in place, Gaza, like many other tragedies, will go back to its low-level, un-newsworthy state of humanitarian crisis, and there will be little hope, or change, in this part of the world in the coming weeks. This is not to say Obama has become an unpopular figure here. If asked about him, most people still mention his speech facing the ruins of the Umayyad Palace in Amman last summer, and the fact that he has signalled a willingness, at least, to talk to all heads-of-state in order to repair international ties damaged by the Bush administration. But for the last three weeks here, you'd have to mention his name for people to talk about him. The great story of America's chance for change in Obama isn't the narrative that dominates the days here. Obama's inauguration is historic and contains, at least, the hope for change. Unlike most American stories pushing humanitarian tragedies off the front page, Obama deserves to dominate the world's news today. From here, the start of Obama's presidency is the start of one dream fulfilled. But the dream of a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians is still denied. It still festers. A hundred miles away from Gaza, it feels as though so much has happened since the optimism of November's election night that, while most here still wish Obama well, there is little to hope for or celebrate. In his inauguration speech, Obama claimed to ""seek a new way forward"" with the Muslim world, and that ""those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy"". Obama still represents a better chance than his predecessors for something lasting and just to be built in the Middle East, but it is far from being fulfilled.",2009-01-20T20:35:42Z,Opinion
59,obama,"We will all remember where we were today - even in lazily cynical Britain Monumental danger has summoned a man whose character matches the hour. Copying Obama must be a global habit There has never been a day like it for Britain's postwar generations. As that inauguration speech echoes out, the globe itself seems to inhale a mighty, collective intake of breath, frighteningly audacious in its hope. A BBC World Service poll shows a tidal wave of optimism about what Obama will do, spread out across a rainbow of nations. Here is the world's wish list: first save global finance from ruin; next get out of Iraq; then fix the climate and bring peace to the Middle East. Yes he can, is the world's expectation. How does the man's arrival feel here? A day like no other, in a time of multiple crisis like none other. In the years of plenty, the British since the war have known little political excitement. Novelists and playwrights scrabble about for drama: the miners' strike, the three-day week, Aldermaston and Greenham vie with the IMF's humiliating bailout or Margaret Thatcher's greed-is-good big bang years, alongside the day we crashed out of the ERM, or Labour's glory night in May 1997. But these are meagre political offerings through the years of fluctuating affluence. The IRA and now Islamist terror terrify - but they feel external, not integral to domestic politics, even if both are bloody paybacks from our past. The cold war came and went without the nuclear apocalypse we grew up expecting any day. When the Berlin wall came down, the great rejoicing was primarily a drama belonging to other people; it was not the end of history either. We fought a surprising number of small wars, hardly ruffling the phlegmatic British body politic: the Conservatives did not fall over the Suez debacle, and Blair was re-elected despite his Iraq disaster. We have not lived in the interesting times of the Chinese curse - but in banal times where politicians needed to be no better than they were. No great crisis summoned a Winston Churchill or a Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That uneventfulness has blunted our politics: people barely vote or express a view, while blase cynicism substitutes for thought, passion or partisanship. Parties clustered in the dead centre are dead on their feet, and no one cares much, except to sneer at politicians' expenses. The bitter truth of deep inequality has been disguised by an era of cheap imported goods and the anyone-can-make-it celebrity myth. An American model of each individual citizen for himself, each individual citizen the architect of his own life's trajectory, has conquered old notions of solidarity, not needed in good times. Look across Europe and little comfort can be drawn from any country's leadership, rendering its collective voice feebly uninspiring. In crisis, the EU risks pulling apart, not together, with rising nationalism and protectionism. Who do you call? The Czech Republic's current EU presidency? There has been little here to inspire political hope. But now Obama comes out of nowhere just when good politics has never mattered more. A complete collapse of the global financial system is not unimaginable. In uncharted waters, billions and trillions gush from governments everywhere, frantically shoring up banks that squandered trust. One thing looks grimly certain, however we get out of this: future deep debts threaten public services, long-lasting unemployment, real pay cuts and changed prospects in need of a new politics. The climate crisis is seen to be worsening with every new report, but worldwide action is still negligible and negligent: the Nasa scientist and leading climate expert Jim Hansen last week warned that only four years remain before an irreversible threshold is crossed, leading to raised sea levels that will drown many major cities. In Gaza, the horror of so many dead Palestinian children is a monstrous challenge to greet Obama. If ever the world needed saving, it's now. So here comes the man who says he can. It's an American mystery that this great pool of genius has usually thrown such minnows into the White House. But the monumental present danger has summoned forth a man who promises the intellect, character and power of persuasion to match the hour. On this day all alive will remember where they were when they saw Obama sworn in, when they heard him speak. I shall be in a Commons meeting room - where Dawn Butler, the black MP for Brent, will be launching ""Bernie's list"" to promote black candidates - with crowds of mainly ethnic-minority young Brent people gathered to watch Obama's speech. Since the rise of Obama, the MP says, throngs have come forward to join her campaign. I shall also see Chuka Umunna, the exceptional Labour candidate for Streatham, south London, address students in Brixton - students whom he finds are as eager as never before to think and do politics. ""Obama has changed everything. You can't overestimate the effect,"" he says. After time on the Obama campaign, Umunna says that the man's blackness is only one wonder: ""He has changed the possibilities of politics itself."" Winning while promising to tax the rich, cut tax for the poor, tackle the climate and reverse Bush's foreign policy, he has made the impossible possible. Let whoever will be cynical do so today: they will have their I-told-you-so moments. Political passion is unfashionable, risky, naive and destined for disappointment. Enthusiasm is rare in British politics, but today is a reminder that it is always worth celebrating the better over the worse. The hope is not just for what the man will do, but that his brand of politics rubs off on politicians everywhere. It wasn't until Obama was elected on a tax-the-rich ticket that Brown and Darling dared to follow suit, 11 years late. This is a day for politicians to take heart and dare to challenge recycled focus group prejudice. Copying Obama needs to become a global habit. In a revealing unpublished interview with the Obamas more than a decade ago, Michelle feared that he was ""too much the good guy for the kind of brutality and scepticism"" of politics. Ruthless calculation is indeed a necessary part of the art, but he seems to have that steely determination too. There is a limit to how moral any effective politician can be: ask that nice Jimmy Carter. Yet this is the day to honour the practice of politics as a high calling, where the power to inspire can swell the hearts of the world. Here at home, a respite from Britain's lazy political cynicism is in order. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion
60,obama,"The lessons of Obama.com MPs should be learning from Obama's projects to include and inspire ordinary citizens – not voting to conceal their expenses He has talked about everything from saving banks to saving the planet. But, this weekend, and just before his inauguration on Tuesday, Barack Obama made his most exciting announcement yet. The doubters said he could never take his ""movement"" into government. He would, they said, have to leave behind the millions who knocked on doors and wrote $20 cheques. But, in a YouTube video to supporters, he found a way to open up government to include them through a new body, ""Organizing for America"", that will use the internet to help ""people like you who fought for change during the campaign to continue fighting for change in your communities"". It's a brave and potentially radical move. This will be the mothership for Obama 2.0. Now compare this to events here in the UK. How are our political leaders seizing on citizens' new appetite for involvement and information about politics? With a jaunty hop in the wrong direction, it seems, by planning to let all MPs keep their expenses a secret. Last week commons leader Harriet Harman found a good day to bury bad news, using the hullabaloo over Heathrow to slip out plans for a vote on the issue. If this passes on Thursday, MPs can keep their expenses secret forever. With government support, and Tory abstentions, it is very likely to pass into law within 24 hours. In my day job I help to run a non-partisan website called TheyWorkForYou.com, which allows normal people free and easy access to anything going on in parliament. From this I know that millions of my fellow citizens want, and need, basic factual information about our democracy. The assumptions in the minds of most MPs who have pushed for concealment of expenses is that the tabloids want this information only to embarrass them with stories about anything from loft extensions to expensive pot plants. And maybe they do. But my experience is that citizens think better of MPs once they know more about them. Equally, I have no problem with MPs claiming legitimate expenses. And I don't think most voters will either, if someone explains why they need to claim them. It might just be me, but it also seems a pretty terrible moment for MPs to be secretive about money. The country is battening down the hatches for the recession. People everywhere are watching the pennies. What sort of signal does it send to give the impression that MPs are supplementing their income through dodgy receipts? Certainly, Obama considers transparency to be a vote winner in the internet age. In April 2006, he and John McCain introduced a bill to the Senate to publish full details of all organisations receiving federal money – which became known as their ""Google for Government"" plan. In the campaign that followed both outdid each other to be more open. Even before the announcement of ""Organizing for America"" Obama's team had begun to walk the walk, posting documents from official meetings on their website and including a raft of pro-transparency measures in their policies. The same should be true here. Gordon Brown says he wants to ""modernise"" our democracy. David Cameron, meanwhile, says we live in a ""post-bureaucratic age"" in which, because of information, ""people are taking more control of their lives."" I agree. But, on this one, both are dropping the ball. In a system shrouded in secrecy, this vote is highly symbolic. Publishing MPs expenses would send the right signals. At the very least, MPs should vote to publish their future expenses in detail, creating positive incentives for prudence and a signal that the whole system is heading in the right direction. The overall direction of policy in what the government likes to call ""digital Britain"" openness should be to follow Obama, not grind into reverse gear. At the moment we're a long way behind the US. We don't have a ""Google for government"". We don't know which lobbyists meet our ministers. We don't see minutes of politician's meetings, or see their diaries. But, next week, if we decide to, we can and should be able to see MPs' expenses. It's about time MPs learned to fear the tabloids a little less, and show a little more faith in their fellow citizens. That's a change we could all believe in.",2009-01-20T13:20:02Z,Opinion
61,obama,"Post-inauguration depression Like John Kennedy and Tony Blair before him, Barack Obama may find it hard to live up to his inspiring rhetoric As Barack Obama rides into Washington, joy unbounded is unleashed around the world. Once again, everyone from the centre to the left feels the tide of history turning our way. But for me, the echoes of similar welcomes for the arrivals into power of John Kennedy and Tony Blair are tinged with the memory of disappointment. This is not the same as simply expecting too much too soon of one man. Especially today, that is a legitimate concern in a complex world of interlocking factors beyond any one person's control. No, I'm referring to an almost wishful misreading of what Kennedy and Blair actually stood for. That they were intelligent, well educated and eloquent invoked a kind of uncritical idealising of the men themselves. When Kennedy started slipping women into the White House through the back door, it only added to his glamour. That he had intellectuals and poets to dinner fuelled the mythology of his Camelot. This was the same man who endorsed the misguided invasion of Cuba. He failed to sign legislation banning federal funding to firms who discriminated against black people. Lyndon Johnson – a southerner – signed it straight away. I recall Kennedy at my graduation from Harvard, on the top steps of Widener Library, legs apart, hands on hips with top hat tipped back and smoking a cigar. From behind he looked like just another pol, albeit an eloquent and intelligent one. Kennedy's death saved him from being outed. That was not the fate of Harold Wilson, who, like Kennedy won a narrow victory on the promise of change – harnessing ""the white heat of technology"". This was the man who let the jump jet among many inventions leave the country. The brain drain started on his watch as underpaid and undervalued scientists left for better jobs. Though he had the courage to challenge racism, the death penalty and homophobia, he is remembered for devious political manoeuvring and appointing his mistress and cronies to the Lords. When Blair won, my company took the day off to celebrate. I even became British to vote against the Tories. But his political self emerged in his first year. He exempted formula one motor racing from the ban on tobacco sponsorship after a donation from Bernie Ecclestone. He carried on his uncritical courtship of the city and private sector – signing letters for Mittal steel, promoting 24-hour drinking, super-casinos and other illiberal causes. He encouraged deregulation, PFI bonanzas that made the Thatcher years look austere. Not to mention the Iraq war. He dismissed the protest of millions before the day was over – ""so Iraqis would have the right to protest too"". Of course, Kennedy, Wilson and Blair did many good things. But the expectation they would live up to their own rhetoric belied the reality of political life, human weakness, vanity and the desire to be liked – as later revealed by their advisers. It is sad and unfair that they may be remembered more for our disappointment in them rather than their achievements. And that's the rub. We want politicians like Obama, Blair, Wilson and Kennedy to be our better selves – indeed better than our better selves. Reading Obama's wonderful autobiography, Dreams of My Father, I could not help but succumb to the hope that this man so painfully self-aware and self-critical might be different. He might just remember his time on the streets of Chicago and the needs of the poor people he tried to help. For him, grassroots are familiar territory, not just a phrase written for him by a smart speechwriter. But there I go, hoping again that Obama will be different. It's that old problem – pessimism of the head and optimism of the heart. But even after all the disillusionment with politics, it keeps me going.",2009-01-20T12:00:01Z,Opinion
62,obama,"Marginalised, but angry The religious right may be splintered and adrift but its most radical elements could become more dangerous than ever The question: Will Obama be good for religion? These are dark days for America's religious right. During the Bush administration, Christian conservatives formed the most powerful social movement in the United States. Now they're marginalised and dejected. Though they succeeded in overturning gay marriage in California, their victory there was a kind of last electoral hurrah. Focus on the Family, the Colorado-based theocon behemoth that's big enough to have its own zip code, pumped so much money into the effort that, in its aftermath, the group had to lay off nearly a fifth of its workforce. In 2004, preachers whipped vast crowds into ecstasies of outrage by railing against a homosexual menace said to be corrupting the nation with sexual sin and leaving it weakened and vulnerable to terrorism. But with tolerance increasing even as the wrecked economy gives voters more concrete things to worry about, anti-gay demagoguery is now paying diminishing returns. In one way, Obama's invitation to the fundamentalist preacher Rick Warren to give the opening prayer at his inauguration signalled that the religious right is still relevant. Yet Warren's behavior during the ensuing controversy shows that he realises where mainstream opinion is heading. Pastor of Southern California's Saddleback megachurch, Warren is a canny impresario who is desperate for popular attention and acclaim, and he clearly realised that the national conversation over his long-standing homophobia was harming his reputation. Thus, besides going on and on about all his gay friends, he scrubbed language from his church's website which had said that someone ""unwilling to repent of their homosexual lifestyle would not be accepted at [sic] a member at Saddleback."" It's telling that even a preacher who has worked to strip gay people of their rights, and who has compared gay sex to incest and peadophilia, fears being seen as intolerant. After all, an older generation of fame-loving clerics wore their homophobia like a badge of honour. Yet if the religious right is splintered and adrift, its most radical elements could become more dangerous than ever. During the election, some Republicans argued that, should Obama become president, we would see renewed terrorist attacks on the United States. They might have been right, though not in the sense they intended. The 1990s saw a deadly series of rightwing domestic terrorist assaults – the Oklahoma City bombing, the bombing of the 1996 Olympics, the murders of several gynaecologists who performed abortions, and many bombings, arson and acid attacks on women's health clinics. As the LA Times reported last year, such violence fell off precipitously during the Bush presidency, for a number of reasons. ""Many observers attribute [the decline] to Sept. 11, for diverting the rage of disaffected Americans away from the US government and toward foreigners, and for fueling the subsequent Patriot Act-driven crackdown,"" wrote the Times. ""Others say the movement began to crumble earlier, when the Y2K disaster, a favourite prediction of conspiracy theorists, failed to materialise."" A third factor, not considered by the paper, was that as the right saw its agenda progress legislatively, some of the frustrated rage that led extremists to defy the law was dissipated. Shut out once again, it's not unlikely that a few on the fringe will once again turn to violence. Indeed, the very economic angst that has rendered the religious right broadly irrelevant may help radicalise a tiny minority of alienated and humiliated people casting about for someone to blame. In the last few months, I've spoken to several people who work at health clinics that perform abortions, and they've told me they're beefing up their security to prepare for that possibility. For liberals, one of the terrifying things about the Bush years was watching people and ideas that had once occupied a weird reactionary underground suddenly move into the centre of American life. Now, those who believe that evolution is a sinister hoax, or that the second coming is imminent and should perhaps be helped along, or that gay people are a threat to the republic and a menace to children, or that legal abortion is a reprise of the Holocaust, will no longer be able to exercise much political power. The most zealous will find another way to be heard.",2009-01-20T08:00:00Z,Opinion
63,obama,"America, under new management Barack Obama sent out a double-edged message today: the US is ready to make a fresh start – but it will be no soft touch If Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, North Korea's King Jong-il, or Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe were watching Barack Obama's inauguration address, they might be forgiven for thinking that the following lines, delivered with cool, determined confidence, were directed straight at them: To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. There, summed up in a couple of sentences, was the double-edged message that America's rookie president wanted to convey to those around the world who have suffered most, and raged, defied and taunted the most, during the confrontational Bush years. The US, under new management, was ready to lead again, was ready to make a fresh start, was prepared to learn from its mistakes, keen to revert, revive and re-base its policies on ageless values handed down from the Founding Fathers. At the same time, he made plain Obama's America would be no soft touch, no pushover for those who chose confrontation and violence instead of rapprochement and dialogue. We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger, and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. Obama's message to the world was also a message to Americans who have watched, often appalled, as the Bush-Cheney axis subjugated the constitution and civil liberties, at home as well as abroad, to the supposedly paramount, unquestionable cause of an endless, elastic, global ""war on terror"" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ... Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more. Obama went on to castigate his predecessor, without actually naming him, summoning as witness the achievements of previous generations. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. Two pledges – to work to roll back the nuclear threat and counter the spectre of global warming – were particularly welcome after the prevarication and obfuscation of the Bush era. But there were also evident blind spots. It is difficult to see quite what Obama meant in pledging to ""forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan"". His policy, as presently understood, will certainly lead to a military escalation that many professional soldiers (and Afghans) fear will only make matters worse. Perhaps Obama's most resonant outreach beyond America's shores was to the lands and peoples of Islam, many of whom became convinced during the Bush presidency that the west had launched a new crusade against them. He addressed Muslims directly, this man whose middle name is Hussein and was not afraid to use it on the biggest day of his life. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,"" he said. When Obama said the world has changed and we must change with it, he was talking to everyone, not just US citizens. The word from the White House, at last, was inclusive. In the face of his example, he suggested the old barriers cannot stand – and the change of which he is the symbol belongs to all, if only they will embrace it. Muslim nations and others will wait to see how, if at all, Inauguration Day's fine, hope-inspiring words translate into action. But whatever happens next, it's good, after eight barren, murderous, divisive years, to once again have an American who knows how to lead.",2009-01-20T18:29:01Z,Opinion

A little before noon today - the precise timing is mandated by the constitution - Barack Obama will become the 44th president of the United States, the culmination of a long electoral journey that began almost two years ago on a similarly freezing day in Springfield, Illinois, when the then 45-year-old declared his candidacy.

""He remains hard to read or label - centrist in his appointments and bipartisan in his style, yet also pushing the broadest expansion of government in generations ... He will eventually have to choose between competing advice and priorities, risking the disappointment or anger of constituencies that for the moment can still see in him what they hope to see.""

65,obama,"The power of the inaugural word Barack Obama's speech in a few hours' time offers a fascinating window on American history Just hours from now, Barack Obama will recite the brief, simple oath of fidelity to the American constitution that will formally make him the 44th president of the United States. Then, he will step up to the podium and deliver the most important speech of his life. His speech, like the oath of office, will be part of a tradition that began with George Washington in 1789. But unlike the oath to ""preserve, protect and defend"" the constitution, the inaugural address has undergone dramatic changes since Washington's day. There have been only 38 inaugural addresses. Five US presidents never gave their set-piece speech at all, having taken over for a portion of a full term from men whose lives were cut short either by an assassin's bullet, like Abraham Lincoln or John F Kennedy, or by illness. William Henry Harrison, who took the oath in 1841, famously delivered the longest inaugural: an oration rich in allusions not only to US constitutional law but also to Greek and Roman history. It lasted nearly two hours in a raging snowstorm. Harrison succumbed to pneumonia one month later. Rereading his words nearly two centuries later, it seems a miracle that he – or those listening – got through it at all. But the same could be said of many of the other inaugurals. Wading through all of them – as Obama and his principal speechwriter Jon Favreau have no doubt also been doing – offers a fascinating window on to American history. But moments of prose far outweigh flights of poetry, particularly in the early years. Few of the speeches have lived long beyond their delivery, and it is they, not surprisingly, that Obama will be seeking to emulate later today. Some themes have been constant – the enduring strength of the constitution, American democracy's sense of divine mission, the covenant between the president and the people who elected him and whose own participation is essential to any of the changes any new incumbent seeks to embody. They will inevitably figure in Obama's speech as well. But the models against whom Obama will inevitably be measured are the few presidents' whose inaugural words somehow soar and resonate still – three of them, above all. The most recent, John F Kennedy, was just 43 when he took office, five years Obama's junior, and memorably spoke of letting ""the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans"". And in an appeal frequently, but much more prosaically, heard in other inaugurals, Kennedy also urged Americans to ask not what their country could do for them, ""but what you can do for your country"". Franklin Delano Roosevelt who, taking office like Obama in the midst of a frightening economic meltdown, memorably declared: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" And when, in the second of his unprecedented four inaugurals the depression had begun to recede, he urged the country to a far wider purpose. ""The test of our progress,"" he said, ""is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."" Above all, there is Abraham Lincoln. His importance to Obama, the first African American president, in the bicentenary year of Lincoln's birth, has been made explicit in the choice of the theme for his inaugural ceremony – ""a new birth of freedom"". That phrase comes not from Lincoln's inaugural addresses but from one of the briefest yet most enduring speeches delivered by any president – at the civil war battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Yet Obama has frequently quoted a lofty passage from Lincoln's first inaugural – ironically, a speech that was aimed at averting civil war in part by assuring the southern states that he would not intervene to end slavery there. ""The mystic chords of memory,"" Lincoln said, ""stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" Obama is not alone in his admiration for Lincoln's oratory. None other than Richard Nixon also reached back to speak of our ""better angels"" in his first inaugural address. But it is not just the words that have distinguished the few presidential inaugurals that have truly stood the test of time. It has been a matrix of qualities: powerful and poetic phrases, movingly delivered, at a time when major challenges in America and the world have coincided with leadership that has found the perfect pitch with which to inspire his country to face them.",2009-01-20T10:30:01Z,Opinion
66,obama,"Gene Robinson's prayer: silent or silenced?  The choice of Gene Robinson to pray at the start of Sunday's inaugural concert was widely seen as a gesture by Obama to balance with an openly gay Christian his choice of the openly homophobic Rick Warren to invoke the blessings of God at the main ceremony today. After all, the inaugural concert was broadcast live to the nation on HBO – all of it, except the opening ten minutes, when Bishop Robinson was praying. Even people at the scene could hardly hear what he was saying, apparently: so his prayer was interrupted, like a rock concert, with cries of ""Turn it up"" and ""We can't hear"" (I assume God needs no amplifier, but who knows?). None of this was apparent to the watching millions because HBO broadcast none of it. The prayer was performed on schedule, at 2:20pm; it had finished when the concert and the broadcast started, also on schedule, at 2:30. Political and religious blogs roiled with outrage. At first HBO was blamed. Now the Obama Inaugural Committee have announced it is all their fault, just a silly misunderstanding, and the prayer will be edited back into the version of the concert which is played as a warm-up for the spectators today. None the less, it looks like a nifty piece of footwork to persuade the supporters of Bishop Robinson (who are the likeliest to attend a celebratory concert, or even the inaugural itself) that Obama is on their side, while suggesting the opposite to the much larger audience of Robinson's opponents, who will watch the whole thing on television. Obama's liberal supporters are understandably reluctant to believe this; but in a perverse kind of way, I hope it was a conspiracy. After all, the whole thing was organised by the Obama organisation, which has been marked by ruthless competence all through a campaign which no one at the beginning thought they had a chance to win. Now that he has won, he is expected to fulfil enormous irreconcilable and largely impossible expectations; a large part of his task over the next four years will be to persuade people that he has in fact done so. Persuading both pro- and anti-gay that he has responded to their concerns won't be anything like the hardest and most important task facing him; but if he couldn't have managed that, what hope he can manage the rest of them?",2009-01-20T18:22:07Z,Opinion
67,obama,"Obama's rhetorical high notes With the beautiful imagery and pragmatic message of this speech, no one can now doubt that America is changing course ""You campaign in poetry, you govern in prose,"" Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York, once famously said. So which was it? Poetry or prose? That was the great balancing act of the speech. How much to inspire and generate even more hope and how much to talk of the scale of the task, the setbacks that will occur, the mistakes that will be made. Like past presidents he tried to reach for the rhetorical high notes that would define the moment. Perhaps, there was not one phrase that stole the show – no Kennedy ""Ask not what your country can do for you"" – but there were echoes of both Kennedy and Martin Luther King in his beautiful imagery. He is a natural speaker, who has the lilt of a preacher summoning his flock on a journey to the Promised Land. And Obama has perfected perhaps the greatest gift of the orator: the pause. When millions, perhaps billions, are watching you, it takes immense inner confidence to let people wait just a second longer for the next phrase. I remember all too well how high expectations were in 1997 when Tony Blair came to office after 18 years of the Tories – and how desperately we tried to suppress them. Well now after eight grim years of President Bush the world is not so much crying out for change as on its knees begging for change. To the governments and peoples of the world Obama offered not the dampening of expectations but the heightening of them – even going so far as promising the flourishing of poor farmers around the world. What he got spot on was the change of tone from the Bush era. This was what made the speech so striking. After this speech no one can be in any doubt that America is changing course. Talking of ""humility"", of the environment, of upholding values, of how America had to earn respect was not only a devastating attack on what had gone before but a signal to the world that there would be meaningful change. But if there was poetry to delight his supporters there was also the prosaic, the business-like: ""Everywhere we look there is work to be done"", he said, laying out the long list of crises at home and abroad needing immediate action. If Obama used his speech for one thing above all else it was to unify people around a common cause. Combining poetry and prose – ""let us brave once more the icy currents"" – he ended with a beautiful piece of imagery with a tough pragmatic message – the next few years are going to be tough but together we will get there.",2009-01-20T19:08:44Z,Opinion

Pretty inappropriate? What were Jews and Muslims and Hindus supposed to do during that? And even Catholics, since he used the Protestant version? Bad form. •Joseph Lowery, the legendary civil rights activist, was great in his benediction.

70,obama,"Hudson plane's engine fan failed two days before crash-landing Aircraft suffered compressor stall but was able to continue on with journey after it appeared to resume functioning The US Airways passenger jet that made a dramatic emergency landing on the Hudson river in New York last week had suffered an engine compressor failure two days earlier, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. ""An entry in the aircraft's maintenance log ... indicates [that] a compressor stall occurred on January 13,"" said a spokesman, Peter Knudson. The compressor, or fan, draws air into the engine. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who was hailed as a hero after all 155 people on board the Airbus 320 survived the emergency landing on 15 January, told air safety investigators the plane lost power to both engines after being hit by a flock of geese. Knudson said the aircraft was not being piloted by Sullenberger when the previous engine problem occurred. He said the board, which investigates transport accidents, planned to interview the pilot in question to learn more about the incident. Knudson said board investigators had not yet discovered ""any anomalies or malfunctions with Flight 1549 from the time it left the gate at LaGuardia airport on January 15 to the point the pilot reported a bird strike and loss of engine power"". CNN reported that passengers on the flight affected by the compressor stall – which also took off from LaGuardia, in New York – said they heard loud bangs followed by an announcement from the pilot that the aircraft was either returning to LaGuardia or would to try to land. There were differing accounts of the pilot's statements, but passengers said the situation appeared to return to normal a short time later and the flight continued on to Charlotte, North Carolina. It is not unusual for a plane to go on to its destination after a compressor stall if the engine returns to normal functioning. Robert Benzon, a senior NTSB investigator, said the examination of the Hudson crash-landing would take a year and the incident would ""be studied for decades"". He said lessons learned from the successful landing on the Hudson could improve air safety. The search for the plane's missing left engine is due to resume today after it was suspended yesterday because ice floes in the river made it too dangerous to put divers or special sonar equipment in the water. Sullenberger spoke to the US president-elect, Barack Obama, yesterday and was invited, with his crew and family, to attend today's inauguration.",2009-01-20T10:32:34Z,News
71,obama,"Taking responsibility for Bush As we bid farewell to George Bush today, Democrats should acknowledge that they gave him a blank cheque after 9/11 As Americans celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama, they, like the rest of the world, are also taking tremendous satisfaction in the departure of the Bush regime. But of course the rest of the world didn't promote Bush to the exalted position from which he and his administration wrought such havoc and mayhem in the first place. That is a burden that must be borne distinctly and uniquely by the US. It is almost always forgotten and almost never noted that the Democrats gave Bush a blank cheque to invade and occupy Iraq less than one month before the 2002 midterm congressional elections. The Democratic strategy was to take the Iraq issue, reportedly in the words of then House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, ""off the table"". If the war resolution was passed, or so the theory went, then Democrats would be able to say ""see, we like to blow things up too"" or words to that effect, and then pivot to domestic issues where Democratic positions enjoyed more support than those of their Republican counterparts on the campaign trail. The Democrats, including senators John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and others who would unsuccessfully seek the presidency themselves in 2004 and 2008, as well as current Senate majority leader Harry Reid, would later contend that they had been ""misled"" by the Bush administration. But in far too many instances, Democrats didn't vote for the Iraq war because they were afraid of Saddam Hussein's WMDs. They voted for the Iraq war because they were afraid that if they didn't the Republicans would call them wimps. ""Neither side wants to talk about the context in which Bush won a blank cheque from Congress to invade Iraq,"" Washington Post columnist EJ Dionne wrote three years after the cheque had been delivered and gleefully endorsed by Bush. ""He doesn't want us to remember that he injected the war debate into the 2002 midterm election campaign for partisan purposes, and he doesn't want to acknowledge that he used the post-September 11 mood to do all he could to intimidate Democrats from raising questions more of them should have raised."" Dionne described the political pressure in the context of the midterm elections as ""a great missing element"" of the debate over how the nation got into the Iraq war. Capitulation to the Bush administration's blatantly optional warmongering on the part of Democrats in Congress was and will remain the most cynical, reckless and shameful act of their political careers. They were wimps all right. Just not for the reasons that the Republicans said. But as Dionne hinted, it is also an act for which the Democrats have mostly not been held accountable by the American media. Odd, that, since the media usually gets a bit of a kick out of exposing inconsistencies, hypocrisies, faults and mistakes, the party affiliation of the transgressor notwithstanding. Then again, the media itself behaved deplorably in the months leading up to the war. Journalists might be skittish about hammering Democrats for catastrophically errant warmongering since their own television news programmes were festooned with more stars and stripes and unquestioning nationalist fervour than at any time in memory, and certainly more than was seemly. Congressional Democrats and the media have come under at least some, albeit still rather isolated, scrutiny for their complicity in the horrible fiasco that is the Bush administration. Meantime, very little attention has been paid to another group that also shoulders a portion of the blame for US insanity that has marked the first decade of the still-young century: the American public. Along with Bush administration's ideological zealotry, arrogance and unquestioning certainty of the rightness of their course, facts be damned; along with Democratic spinelessness; along with media timidity and fear that someone somewhere might call them – gasp! – a liberal; and along with all the other causes and excuses both tragic and stupid that led to the invasion of Iraq, there is one other that tends to get overlooked: an attack polled well. After 9/11, people in the US were, not to put too fine a point on it, bloodthirsty as hell. But bombing the caves of poorly armed Taliban fighters in the Afghan wilderness was not nearly dramatic or conclusive enough to satisfy the lust for vengeance back in the US. Iraq – now there was a country with an actual army, in uniforms and stuff. Invading Iraq would be more of a regular war, a good war just like the one grandpa fought. Never mind that Iraq posed no threat to the security of US citizens as they drove to and fro in their SUV's festooned with patriotic auto magnets. Iraq was full of Arabs. And they didn't like us. In the words of one bumper sticker spotted at the time: ""Let's kick their ass and steal their gas."" Now the American public is more or less clinging to the same excuses offered up by the Democrats and the media – gosh, simply everybody thought that Iraq had WMDs (or something to do with 9/11, a lie that the Bush administration was more inclined to spread than discourage). Of course, from Hans Blix to Mohamed El Baradei to millions of protesters the world over, everybody didn't think that. And even many people who did still protested the war as an unnecessary exercise in military aggression on the part of untrustworthy warmongering ideologues. If a large segment of the American public was misled, perhaps it is because they were hearing what they wanted to believe. Oh boy! Another enemy! Bang bang! They eagerly backed arguably the biggest ""oops"" in recorded history. And then they ratified their mistake by re-electing Bush in 2004. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and others have urged that Bush and Company not be given a free pass for their criminal acts, that the Bush administration abuses should be investigated, no matter how uncomfortable such investigations might be for an Obama administration and a Democratic Congress that is understandably focused on the future, not the past. The fact is the US could do with some truth and reconciliation. But an honest assessment of the Bush years has to take account of the fact that, difficult though it is to believe at the moment, from 9/11 until Katrina the American public approved of Bush, often overwhelmingly and sometimes wildly. Yes, Americans can thank goodness or Goddy McGod or whoever/whatever it is they're in the habit of thanking for the departure of the worst president in history of the United States. Good riddance indeed. Meantime, it may take a while, but someday Americans are going to acknowledge that sometimes Bush wasn't leading them or misleading them. He was following them.",2009-01-20T17:00:01Z,Opinion
72,obama,"Clemency and conversation in president's last day  President George Bush yesterday issued last-minute acts of clemency to two US border guards and made a final round of calls to world leaders, including Gordon Brown, to say goodbye. Ignacio Ramos and José Compeán were sentenced to 10 years for trying to cover up the shooting in 2005 of a Mexican drug dealer, Osvaldo Alderete, as he tried to escape across the Rio Grande, abandoning a van loaded with marijuana. The sentencing at the time produced an outcry, with supporters saying the pair were just doing their job. A US administration official said Bush agreed the sentence was excessive. Compeán and Ramos, who have served about two years, are expected to be released from prison within two months. The president can make pardons up till 11.59 am today, but Bush advisers said there would be no more. There had been expectations Bush might offer protection for US officials involved in torture at Guantánamo, and offer pardons in a raft of high-profile political and financial scandal cases. One of the biggest cases involved former White House adviser, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, who became caught up in a CIA leak scandal. Although Bush has already commuted his jail sentence, his supporters had hoped for a full pardon. Bush, who returned to the White House after a final weekend with his family at Camp David, phoned some leaders to thank them for their support during the eight years of his presidency. Among those he called was Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, who along with Tony Blair was one of his strongest supporters in Europe of the invasion of Iraq. Other leaders to receive a call included Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, and former president Vicente Fox of Mexico. Bush has one final act as president: handing over power to Barack Obama at noon tomorrow. But the press corps in Washington will also be watching to see whether, in spite of White House claims, he will make any further last-minute pardons, as his predecessors have done. With the new acts of clemency yesterday, Bush has granted a total of 189 pardons and 11 commutations, fewer than half as many as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan. Reagan issued 406 in eight years. The White House has been inundated with hundreds of pleas for clemency, including one from US senator Lisa Murkowski for the disgraced former Alaska senator Ted Stevens, a veteran Republican who was convicted in Washington in October of seven charges of felony for failing to declare gifts from an oil company.",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News

That number is 25% more than last year. The attendance of 20 government delegations and 300 journalists at the World Future Energy Summit, has brought suggestions from one speaker that this had become the energy Davos, in reference to that yearly economic gathering. So no lack of interest then — despite the enormous cost of staying here and getting about in this petro-dollar fuelled Gulf state.

London-based consultancy, New Energy Finance, produced figures recently that showed 50% increases in annual growth volumes for clean tech stocks three years in a row almost came to a grinding halt in 2008. Even BP admitted yesterday that its budgets were under pressure at a time of plunging crude prices. But despite continuing financial chaos among lenders (such as Royal Bank of Scotland), there is an overwhelming sense that the time has finally come for renewables, especially given the changes in the US, courtesy of Barack Obama. Solar companies were trumpeting their wares at the summit today with a procession of industry leaders who promised that their latest products were going to breakthrough the cost and efficiency barriers that have held back the sector. Kieran Drain, chief executive of California-based NanoGram outlined how lasers and nanotechnology can bring the holy grail of a new technology that fits between the traditional divide between high-efficiency crystal and low-cost photovoltaics. Kees van der Leun, a director of Holland's Econcern, said even without major technology breakthroughs the cost of producing solar cells was plummeting much quicker than politicians realised. He predicted prices would half in the next five or six years ""for sure."" He also poured cold water on statistics from the International Energy Agency which had talked about 10 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by 2020. ""I think [that target] will be done this year."" This is one of the reasons why many believe the Germans have spearheaded a new International Renewable Energy Agency. They want a more accurate assessment of where the sector has got to than the oil-driven IEA seems able to give. The British government told me last night they are still considering whether to join. Why? They won't say, but you suspect it's out of misplaced loyalty to the IEA which it helped establish and which sees IREA as a threat.

75,obama,"Pound hits 7-year low against the dollar  Sterling tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar in seven-and-a-half years today, as traders digested the implications of the government's latest multibillion-pound lifeline to support the banking sector. On the foreign exchange markets the pound shed more than six cents to hit $1.3860, its weakest point since June 2001. Banking shares also came under further pressure, with shares in Lloyds Banking Group plummeting almost 50% at one stage, to 33.8p. Barclays lost another 12% to 77.5p. Yesterday morning the pound was worth almost 10 cents more at $1.47, but proposals for the UK taxpayer to insure bank loans and support the mortgage market piled pressure on the currency. One commentator even claimed that the UK economy was ""finished"". News of a smaller-than-expected fall in inflation last month eased fears of deflation but failed to help sterling. City economists had forecast a fall in the consumer price index to 2.7% last month, down from 4.1% in November, but the figure came out at 3.1%. Gordon Brown yesterday committed £50bn to fund asset purchases by the Bank of England, but the final cost could be much higher and will require a further increase in government borrowing. ""The risk now is that people are looking back to the run on the pound in 1931, when Britain came off the gold standard and sterling fell by 31%,"" said Richard Turner of IG Index, the spread-betting company. Sterling has already dropped by a third from November 2007's high of $2.11 against the dollar. But with the dollar hitting a six-week high against a basket of major currencies today, there are fears that the pound could be poised for further falls. The pound also dropped against the euro to a two-week low of €1.0742. Turner believes that now the pound has fallen through the $1.40 mark, it could quickly slide as low as $1.30. He has seen an increase in the number of people short-selling sterling, betting that it will fall. ""Our clients are more comfortable about shorting the pound,"" said Turner. ""This isn't the unwinding of long trades; this is people speculating that sterling will go even lower."" Other traders said the inauguration of Barack Obama was helping the dollar, amid optimism over his economic recovery plan. British economy 'finished' Jim Rogers, the veteran US investor, claimed the UK economy was ""finished"". ""I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have,"" Rogers told Bloomberg. ""It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK."" Yesterday, Spain became the first major country to be downgraded by ratings agency S&amp;P, from the top rating of AAA to AA+. S&amp;P said the ""structural weaknesses"" in the Spanish economy, and the likelihood of a long recession, made holding the country's debt more risky. One City analyst said there was now a possibility the UK could follow Spain and see its debt downgraded, although S&amp;P indicated yesterday that the UK was in a better position to handle its growing debts. Meanwhile, renewed concern over the world economic downturn continued to hammer the oil price, which dropped 8% today. The cost of a barrel of US crude fell to $33.53, down more than $3. Economic data due out this week is expected to show that the Chinese economy, long the driver of global growth, is slowing fast. The UK will also officially be in recession from Friday, when the latest data is released. The oil price had risen in recent weeks in response to the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas, which cut supplies across parts of Europe.

76,obama,"The nuclear options The latest bank salvage is plainly not enough. Soon we might be looking at a huge write-off of debts Nothing debauches the concept of money quite as much as watching it being thrown around like confetti by your bank manager. Anyone who claims to have kept up with the blizzard of blank cheques written on our behalf is missing the point: no one knows how much it will cost to prop up the British banking industry because no one knows whether it is worth anything at all. Yesterday's stockmarket reaction would suggest it isn't. Investors responded to the government's otherwise sensible rescue scheme by running for the exit doors. The only certainty is that lending by British banks during the boom was measured in trillions, not the mere billions we are throwing at the problem today. RBS alone has liabilities of £1.8 trillion. Nationalising it would increase the national debt by 370% - and that's not even counting the theoretical cost of financial derivatives, whose net worth we may never really know. It used to be unthinkable that the government would assume responsibility for anything quite so large. But the unthinkable is becoming official policy with terrifying speed. Yesterday saw the Bank of England warming up its printing presses, announcing the mechanism it would use for direct increases in the money supply when there is no more room for interest-rate cuts. Regulators also gave the green light for commercial banks to ""print"" more money, by easing the requirement for them to hold reserves when they make new loans. All three of these nuclear options (nationalisation, quantitative easing and relaxed reserve requirements) would ordinarily rank at the extreme end of the policy spectrum. But these are not ordinary times. So what happens if this doesn't work? When all else fails, the only logical conclusion is to forgive the debts. Just as we ultimately acknowledged the need to cancel third world debt, the time may have come to look into our own financial soul and move on from this debacle. As Niall Ferguson reminded us recently in his book on money, there is precedent in the Bible (Leviticus) for such a ""jubilee"" to be held every 50 years. ""Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother."" Keynes also called for a general cancellation of debts and reparations arising from the first world war. To an extent, this is already happening - when, for instance , banks ""write off"" toxic debt. Similarly, the large number of companies going bankrupt is a sign of borrowers walking away from unsustainable loans: the problem is that many also cease to trade at all. Anything on a more constructive scale would need international co-operation. Without that a jubilee would turn into a rout: international investors would flee the UK, and the City would lose what reputation it has left. But the good news is that almost everyone is in the same boat, and Barack Obama faces the problem on an even bigger scale. The same pressures are visible in the eurozone. So what's the catch? The obvious one is that for every debt, there is a saver. Where would that leave pensions - or in fact the whole system of capitalism? Until confidence was restored, firms and individuals would have to learn to live without investment, relying on cashflow to fund growth. It might delight Marxists, but it would be a socially retrograde step, entrenching the wealth gap in non-financial assets like property. Fortunately, things are not as bad as that yet. But the principle is one that could be extended in a targeted way, ring-fenced to protect ordinary savers. After all, if the banks are bankrupt then so is our financial system. dan.roberts@theguardian.com",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion
77,obama,"Russia must face reality The financial crisis should help the nation see it is not the world's leader-in-waiting, and start to address its creaking, corrupt reality As Barack Obama prepares for his inauguration, one analyst has suggested that the US faces more serious trouble than even the most pessimistic economists have forecast. The entire economy is set to crash by November, leaving states fighting among themselves and leading to disintegration into six parts by summer 2010. As the weakened parts fall under foreign influence, Russia will take the golden opportunity to replace the US as the world's foremost superpower. According to the former KGB analyst and dean of the international relations department at the Russian foreign ministry's Diplomatic Academy, Igor Panarin, this scenario has ""a roughly 50% chance of coming true"". This theory has been receiving widespread attention in the Russian state-controlled media. Another story of a similar ilk has sat at the top of the state-backed Moscow News's most-read list for the past few months: a ""prophetess"" called Vanga has predicted that Russia will dominate the world. Economists' assessments of Russia, a country that currently accounts for about 3% of global GDP (comparable with the UK) and with per capita GDP at a quarter of the US level, are somewhat more sobering. Its economy is in serious trouble after years of neglected reforms, over-reliance on commodities and a failure to tackle rampant corruption. Some point to Russia's large currency reserves, but these have declined by over one quarter since August, and are rapidly disappearing to prop up the banking system, Kremlin-connected oligarchs and the sliding rouble. The recent gas conflict with Ukraine has been read by many as driven by the increasing financial woes of Gazprom and Russia. The Russian leadership's response to the crisis has so far had two main thrusts – first, to protect favoured oligarchs; second, to protect the leadership from popular dissent by stopping the rouble from plummeting. No one really knows how bad Russia's economic situation is because of an opacity fed by the desire to maintain calm and cover up problems and mistakes. But that image is struggling under the weight of the crisis. Factories stand idle across Russia, and surveys show that Russians are very worried about the economy as wage cuts and layoffs hit. In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, December's economic protests have turned political. For years, critics have pointed to the need for an open debate within Russia about the country's path in order to find the best way for economic and social progress and to minimise the effect of any crisis such as the current one. But with dollars dripping down from the top and state-controlled TV pushing the image of Putin and Russia as strong and growing after years of stagnation and hardship, ideas other than the Putin model struggled to take hold. But in Russia's history, crises have often served to sober up perceptions of the country. Nicholas I (1825-1855) was renowned as the ""gendarme of Europe"". During his reign, the intelligentsia complained constantly of repression from the state on the one hand and disinterest from people on the other. Then Russia was crushed by the British in the Crimean War. Nicholas committed suicide and Russian strength was revealed to be a self-propagating myth. As society opened up, interest increased in other paths that Russia could take; people began to discuss questions of reform. London-based Russian intellectual Alexander Herzen's journal The Bell, which detailed abuses of power by state officials and proposed new, different paths for Russia, was read avidly. This discussion led the way for the reforms of Alexander II. Public debate had opened up new possibilities for economic and social change, alternative paths to a country directed by autocratic decision alone (which were ultimately not taken). As the crisis increasingly reveals the gulf between Russia's self-image and its real possibilities, the time of Panarin and Vanga could be coming to an end. Talk will surely move from fantasies about Russia challenging the US to the country's very real internal problems and how to solve them. Previously deaf ears will begin to listen as the failures of the current leadership become clear in everyday life. The question that will then be raised is one that has been asked of Russian leaders for centuries: liberalisation, or crack down?",2009-01-20T07:00:01Z,Opinion
78,obama,"Diary  Amid both joy and euphoria, the threats to Obama are many. We need not dwell on them. Others are on the case. We have an official threat and analysis bulletin released in Washington that lists incidents and possible problems over the inauguration period. Among the incidents picked up on the radar, clearly a strong one is ""Starbucks Site Firebombed in London"". It tells of an attack in Whitechapel, linked, it says, to ugly tensions unleashed by the crisis in the Gaza Strip, and adds: ""The people in this constituency have a history of voting for the RESPECT Party run by George Galloway MP."" Recently, it says, he called on supporters to ""go to shopping centers and shut down Israel's shops"". In fact, he sought a boycott of Israel Shops, mobile retailers selling Israeli goods from malls - but they're right, George is always worth watching, even from the US. Never dull. Who should get the blame, or perhaps take credit, for Labour's big idea on social mobility: the duty on public authorities to pursue social equality? Should it be Harriet Harman, or Trevor Phillips who is said to feel a ""pang of annoyance"" that Harriet is publicly identified with what could be Labour's greatest legislative achievement. It is the equalities commission, some say, that has been in the box seat. ""I am obsessed by it, therefore colleagues are having to be interested in it,"" muttered Phillips the other day. Alas, the price of obsession. Yes, class is on the agenda again, and while the middle classes have a fine time, every group has problems. Danny Wallace, comedian and author, gives readers of Shortlist magazine two examples overheard. ""The only seat in the bistro was on a communal table but in the end it was fine as I found myself folded into the cultural melee,"" said one sufferer. ""I keep confusing the name of my cleaner with the name of the heroine in my novel,"" moaned the other. Does anyone care for these people? Who empathises. Not Harriet. Not Trevor. Raised stakes within the National Union of Students, where there is lively debate about constitutional plans that might exclude minority representatives from a new decision-making body. The scrap has been fought internally, but with a vote due today, the NUS black students campaign has brought in the big guns: try Doreen Lawrence, Benjamin Zephaniah and Diane Abbott. But when it sought to publicise this fact last week, its emails were blocked by union HQ. It's getting nasty. Heads down. So what shall we say about Dubya, the artist formerly known as the leader of the free world? Will we, with just the faintest nod to Shakespeare, look kindly upon him; say that nothing in his presidency became him like the leaving of it. Much more important is the question of what we shall say on his farewell bumper sticker, and it has been a tough choice to be sure. We had many entries, for which we are grateful, and though the humour was gentle, none showed even a scintilla of respect or regard for the man. We respect that. Take a bow. Our panel of judges, all drawn from privatised companies with undeclared links to Dick Cheney, and thus all shielded from prosecution, liked Tom Burnett's suggestion: ""Obama's in hand, worth two of a Bush""; while Derrick Cameron deserves mention for his creation: ""I came, Iraq, I fucked it up"" - best said in a Texan drawl. The judges also applauded the overview of two disastrous terms, submitted by Mike Walton, for ""Fiddled in - Drummed out"" would make a super bumper sticker, and indeed a thoughtful title for Dubya's memoir. (This will be ready just as soon as Mr Cheney is able to finish it. Please, a little more patience.) But at the end of the day, what we wanted was something that would look good on the former president's pick-up as it trundles away from Washington en route to Texas - and this we found in Deirdre Mason's winning vision: ""No, Dubya - sunset's THIS way"". Bye bye to him. Well done to her. diary@theguardian.com",2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News
79,obama,"Calls to nationalise RBS and Lloyds as markets lose faith in bail-outs Sterling hammered on currency markets as traders take fright at state of UK banking sector and cost of government rescue John McFall, confidant of Gordon Brown and chairman of the Treasury select committee, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland tonight after shares in both banks crumbled, the pound skidded to a seven-year low against the dollar and government bonds were sold off sharply. As markets took fright at the state of Britain's banking sector and the wider economy the day after the government's latest bail-out plan, shares in the loss-making RBS slumped to 10.3p, continuing Monday's 66% slide, while the new Lloyds Banking Group continued to fall rapidly as it looked likely that many UK banks would not be paying any dividends for years. McFall, an influential Labour MP, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland ""for the sake of financial stability"". In an article in the Financial Times co-authored by the veteran private equity expert Jon Moulton, McFall said: ""Let us get it over with – nationalise the pair of them."" The pound fell to $1.386, hitting the lowest point since June 2001. It also slumped below €1.07. Sterling was not helped by a surge of confidence in the dollar, as Barack Obama was sworn in as US president. Jim Rogers, a veteran US investor, said the UK economy was ""finished"". He told Bloomberg: ""I would urge you to sell any sterling. It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK."" Rumours were awash in febrile markets that ratings agencies could downgrade the UK's sovereign debt ratings if the government had to issue tens of billions of pounds of government bonds to finance its latest rescue for the banks. A downgrade would increase the cost of raising debt for Britain, the world's fifth largest economy. The price of insuring British debt against default also rose sharply. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, was forced in Brussels to dismiss market talk that he, like Denis Healey in 1976, would have to turn to the IMF for a bail-out, saying he had laid out at the pre-budget report in November how he intended to pay for the government's schemes. But Peer Steinbrück, Germany's finance minister, also at the EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels, said he and others had urged a swift return to sound public finances and expressed fears about the situation in Britain, which is forecast to have a 9.5% budget deficit next year, and Ireland, whose deficit in 2010 is put at 13%. Saying he did not understand Darling's scheme to insure UK banks' multibillion-pound toxic assets via the Bank of England and a ""bad bank"", he said: ""I am sceptical that a national scheme will work."" Steinbrück echoed market fears about the UK scheme by saying it was unclear how to find the right price for the securities in a bad bank. The bank might have to be capitalised with up to 30% of what was on lenders' balance sheets – up to €200bn. The bail-out also worries the City. ""The market rightly fears the long-term fiscal costs of a collapsing banking system,"" said Graham Turner, of consultancy GFC Economics. The gilts market was spooked by the potential costs to the public purse. Gilts prices fell sharply on the fear of greater supply, which in turn pushed yields up to 3.55% for a 10-year benchmark gilt. Falling yields recently have helped bring down the price of some corporate borrowing and fixed-rate mortgages. Shares in Lloyds lost half their value before ending 31% lower at 44.8p. Lloyds' stockmarket value is just £6bn – barely half the sum put in by the taxpayer. RBS, soon to be almost 70% state-owned after a £20bn cash injection, has a stockmarket value of less than £4bn. In 2007 it was worth £78bn. Barclays was also hit hard, touching 69p before ending 17% down at 72.9p, to be worth £6bn – little more than the £5.3bn of profits it expects for 2008 and down from £58bn 18 months ago. Even HSBC, the UK's biggest bank and the only one not to have raised funds from investors, was caught in the rout. It fell 3% to a stockmarket value of about £58bn – less than half the £120bn it was valued at before the credit crunch began. Darling insisted he had won backing in Brussels for the bail-out. EU ministers said: ""Member states continue to remain committed to taking all necessary steps."" He said the statement proposed to the EU's Czech presidency by Britain – which demands the proper functioning of credit channels through banks' use of their capital reserves – showed EU unity. News that UK inflation had its biggest fall in 17 years, dropping to 3.1% in December from 4.1% a month before, did little to calm markets, partly because it had been expected to fall further, but also because the Bank of England has already slashed interest rates to a historic low of 1.5% and is widely expected to cut them further. Mervyn King, Bank governor, paved the way last night for ""quantitative easing"" – radical steps to combat deflation and thaw credit markets – by promising to start buying corporate bonds and other assets within ""weeks, not months"", to pump cash into the system. In a speech to the CBI in Nottingham, he said the Bank was ready to take ""unconventional measures"" to kick-start the economy, once the weapon of interest rate cuts was exhausted. King said as well as buying bonds and other securities (to raise reserves on banks' balance sheets and encourage them to lend) the Bank would also consider buying particular classes of assets where markets were malfunctioning. He also threw his weight behind Alistair Darling's new rescue package for the banking sector. A minister has admitted that the centre-piece of the rescue – the scheme to insure banks against unexpected losses – may last nine years. The admission made by the City minister, Lord Myners, contrasts with Gordon Brown's claim on Monday that the scheme would be short-lived. Myners told peers: ""We are probably talking about a policy duration of no fewer than five years, and probably no longer than eight or nine years … we need a policy that will take financial markets through this economic downturn and beyond."" Inflation is widely expected to turn to deflation this year as the recession deepens and the impact of falling oil prices feeds fully into the figure. Oil prices fell as low as $32.70 a barrel yesterday, partly on the resumption of Russian gas supplies and partly due to renewed strength in the dollar. That is barely a fifth of the record level hit last summer. The FTSE 100, though, was little moved overall, closing at 4091.17 points on the day as firming pharmaceutical, tobacco and oil shares counterbalanced the losses in bank shares.

80,trump,"Divisive, ungracious, unrepentant: this was Trump unbound Inaugural speeches are meant to heal, but he evoked dark historical echoes and confirmed our worst fears Well, what were you expecting? Did you somehow think that the Donald Trump of the long, bitter campaign of 2016 would be miraculously transformed in the Washington rain, emerging as a kinder, gentler man, ready to serve as healer of the nation and humble steward of the free world? Because if you did, you were sorely disappointed. Of course he didn’t change. The naive thought he might shift a year ago, when he became the Republican frontrunner, or in the summer, when he became that party’s nominee, or in November, when he won the election. And some, finally, clung to the hope that he would “pivot”, undergoing a metamorphosis as he placed his hand on the Bible and took the oath to become America’s 45th president. But they were wrong. The Trump on the steps of the Capitol was the same Trump the world has come to know and fear. As he did at his party convention in Cleveland, he came with a message full of anger and foreboding, slamming the record of his predecessor and depicting a bleak American dystopia. He spoke of “American carnage”, of gangs and drugs, crime and decay. And he was unafraid of the darkest historical echoes. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first,” he said, “America first” – embracing once again the slogan of the 1930s nativist movement of appeasers and antisemites who sought to keep the US out of the war against Nazism. Elsewhere, in rhetoric that sounded chilling coming from a would-be strongman who allegedly used to keep a volume of Hitler’s speeches at his bedside, he declared, “We are one nation … We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.” For a listening world, there was little of comfort. He announced a new age of protectionism, not hiding from the word. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,” he said, in defiance of the historical experience that says protection leads, in fact, to crisis and world war. There was no mention of Nato or anything that might smack of multilateral cooperation. Instead Trump used his inauguration to usher in a new, Darwinian era in international relations. From now on, “all nations [will] put their own interests first”. That’s how Moscow and Beijing see the world, but it’ll be a shock for those smaller nations who have long looked to the US to maintain something close to a rules-based international system. In other words, Trump did what he always does: he shredded the rule book. Inaugural speeches are meant to be exercises in national unity, binding the wounds of a divided people and sending a message that might hearten the rest of the world. Not for Trump. There was no gracious nod to his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, no hand outstretched to those who didn’t vote for him. Instead, he spoke to his own voters, doubling down on the message of economic nationalism that brought him those narrow margins in the key rust-belt states. He spoke of “rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape”, the workers who had been “forgotten” and “left behind”, and promised they would be forgotten no more. For them this speech – and, indeed, slogans such as America first – would have been compelling. They will be readier than ever to believe that he is about to make good on his multiple, impossible promises – including the eradication of “radical Islamic terror” from the face of the Earth – as well his defining and closing pledge: to make America great again. So what should those who have long dreaded this moment do now? For some, the inauguration marks the launch of what they’re already calling “the resistance”, as if they are facing not just an unloved government but a tyranny. Note the banner held aloft by one group of demonstrators that read simply: “Fascist.” Placards and protests will have their place in the next four years. But those who want to stand in Trump’s way will need to do more than simply shake their fists. The work of opposition starts now – and here’s how it might work. At the front of the queue, as it were, are the press. There’s no doubt Trump sees it that way. With Clinton out of the way, the media has become his enemy of choice. The media’s very existence seems to infuriate him. Perhaps because it’s now the only centre of power he doesn’t control. With the White House and Congress in Republican hands, and the casting vote on the supreme court an appointment that’s his to make, it’s no wonder the fourth estate rankles: he already controls the other three. That puts a great burden of responsibility on the press. Trump has majorities in the House and Senate, so often it will fall to reporters to ask the tough questions and hold the president to account. And it won’t be easy, if only because war against Trump is necessarily a war on many fronts. Just keeping up with his egregious conflicts of interests could be a full-time job, to say nothing of his bizarre appointments, filling key jobs with those who are either unqualified or actively hostile to the mission of the departments they now head. It’s a genuine question whether the media has sufficient bandwidth to cope. But one move could help. Journalists might need to break the competitive habits of a lifetime and, every now and then, work as a team. That need was illustrated in last week’s press conference, when Trump turned on, and refused to take a question from, a CNN reporter, branding the network purveyors of “fake news.” Had the other journalists present refused to ask questions of their own until their CNN colleague was allowed his moment, Trump would have had to give way. In a similar vein, reporters should get into the habit of following up their colleagues’ inquiries. It may not force Trump or his spokespersons to answer awkward questions, but at least it’ll make it a tad harder for them to ignore them. But there’s also a question of focus, for the press and for opponents alike. It’ll be tempting to go after Trump for his late-night tweets, for the insults he will surely keep firing off – whether at Meryl Streep or the cast of Hamilton – and for the general boorishness that has made him so repellent to so many millions. Tempting, but if it’s allowed to dominate the way we speak about this president, wrong. Listen to the advice of the Italian scholar Luigi Zingales, who recalls the long battles against Silvio Berlusconi – like Trump, a master player of the media, orange-hued and coated in a Teflon that meant no scandal ever stuck. Berlusconi was in the end defeated only by those who “focused on the issues, not on his character”. Attacking Trump as a douchebag might be cathartic, but it’s unlikely to be effective. Too many Americans knew that about him but voted for him anyway. Better to attack Trump as a president. Which is not to say that there’ll be no room for mockery. Lord knows, laughter will be a crucial weapon against Trump, as it is against all authoritarian strongmen.(Indeed, humour seems alien to Trump: comedy director Judd Apatow this week noted that he had never seen the new president laugh properly.) Alec Baldwin and Saturday Night Live, along with Trevor Noah, Samantha Bee and others are the bearers of a solemn, quasi-constitutional duty: to point a jeering finger at the emperor with no clothes. But that will count for nothing if there is not a popular movement of dissent, one that exists in the real world beyond social media. Some believe the mass rally is about to matter more than ever. Trump, remember, is a man who gets his knowledge of the world from television, and who is obsessed by ratings. How better to convey to him the public mood of disapproval than by forcing him to see huge crowds on TV, comprised of people who reject him? And this will have to be backed by serious, organised activism. The left can learn from the success of the Tea Party movement, which did so much to obstruct Barack Obama. That will force congressional Democrats to consider whether they too should learn from their Republican counterparts, thwarting Trump rather than enabling him. And opponents should keep their eyes on the prize. Yesterday’s most poignant image was of the Obamas leaving the White House for the last time. Eight years ago, that was Bush and Cheney. One day, it will be Donald Trump. That moment will come. The task now is to ensure it comes sooner rather than later.",2017-01-20T18:30:08Z,Opinion
81,trump,"14 ways to Trump-proof your life Don’t panic: you can take action, and make yourself safer. Here’s an incomplete list of tips and resourcesTrump’s here. We have four years to write a better story We could’ve avoided Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons If there’s anything that will ensure the next four years aren’t a total disaster – and that Trump serves just one term – it’s collective action. In that vein, this list attempts to set out two things: some basic ways to protect yourself as Trump takes office, and ideas for challenging his agenda, in your own backyard and on the national stage. It’s incomplete, of course. But if you learn just one lesson, let it be this: take precautions, but don’t forget to take action too. Protest against the inauguration Organizers have issued a call for people to converge on inauguration day (J20) to “delegitimize Trump and all he represents”. You could be one of them! For more information, check out disruptj20.org. Can’t make it to the capital? Join a demonstration happening in your city. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people will converge for the Women’s March, unified by a broad set of principles. You could even strike. Take action beyond J20, too Resist Here – an effort backed by the Working Families party – invites anyone anywhere to put pressure on their elected officials to reject Trump’s agenda, complete with resources and step-by-step guides for those new to organizing. Support people working with groups under attack Whether you’re an immigrant yourself or looking to support communities that might come under threat as a result of Trump’s policies, Cosecha might be a good place to start. Just after the election, its organizers put out an open call for people to turn everything from college campuses to churches to cities into sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. You can pressure the institutions you’re part of to do the same, and may also want to attend a bystander intervention training in your area. Join up If you’re in a union, get more involved in it. If your workplace isn’t organized, organize it! If you’re black, you could join up with Black Lives Matter network chapter near you, or BYP100. If you’re a Latino or Latina, you might get involved with Mijente. If you’re Jewish you could join #IfNotNow. If you’re a Bernie Sanders fan, maybe join the Democratic Socialists of America. Whatever group makes the most sense for you. There’s no point in being angry about Trump on your own. If you have the means, give to the grassroots Because grassroots groups will never be as well funded as Trump’s cabinet picks, donating to any of those listed above wouldn’t hurt either – even if it’s just a few dollars. And the water protecters at Standing Rock could always use funds and supplies. Want some other suggestions? Try MPower Change, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity, Fight For The Future, Put People First, No More Deaths, the Movement for Black Lives, Southerners on New Ground, the Indigenous Environmental Network and the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance. Get legal help If you are undocumented or have concerns about your legal status, this directory can help you find services available in your state. If you’re able to get pregnant but don’t want to right now, get an IUD In short order, reproductive rights could come under assault. You should consult your healthcare provider to determine which contraceptive method is best for you. One nice thing about IUDs, though, is that they can last for up to 12 years, meaning they will weather Trump’s administration and then some. (While you’re there you can get STI testing or take advantage of the other sliding scale health services Planned Parenthood and other sexual health providers offer.) Bolster your data security The Electronic Freedom Foundation has a great guide here, as do the Intercept and HackBlossom. Here’s one more. Read them over, and do what you need to to keep yourself safe. Support independent media As mainstream outlets become increasingly corporatized, keeping independent publishers afloat will be critical – especially if press freedoms start to come under attack. Donating to public radio and television is always a good call, as is supporting smaller outfits like Democracy Now!, In These Times and Dissent. (And of course, you can become a member of the Guardian for less than $7 a month.) Read up on how resistance has worked in the past The works of Charles Payne and Frances Fox Piven might be good starting points, as is – for a more recent example – the Ferguson Syllabus. Look abroad Autocrats are nothing new on the global stage. Countries all over the world are undergoing their own far-right and anti-democratic resurgences, from Turkey to Brazil to Poland to France, and can offer lessons for those looking to take on Trump. If you can, get a passport too. Just in case. Learn from the Tea Party If you’re mad about Trump, you may not be a fan of the Tea Party. But there are vital lessons to take from the movement. Four former congressional staffers – all of whom were on staff while the Tea Party was dishing out fresh hell to Obama and Congressional Republicans alike – have compiled a no-frills guide on how to apply their strategies to resisting Trump’s agenda. Read it and get started.

82,trump,"The honeymoon is already over for President Trump Shocking poll numbers tell of a uniquely difficult path for the new commander-in-chief. And that’s before the inevitable scandals startDonald Trump sworn in as 45th president Today marks the beginning of the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. It isn’t wishful thinking to begin the countdown to Trump’s self-destruction on his inauguration day. It’s merely a statement of the facts of presidential life: this is no longer a game played out on TV and Twitter. Everything changes when The Apprentice star takes the oath of office on that stage outside the Capitol. Legally, politically and diplomatically, Trump’s world is utterly transformed. What passed before as media outrage now has a measurable impact on his presidential polls and by extension his presidential power. What passed before as a sycophantic discussion with his own attorney now opens the door to endless litigation and the clear and present danger of impeachment. What passed before as a curious cozying up to Vladimir Putin is now transformed into a multi-agency investigation into illegal foreign payments to undermine the election. We should not confuse populism with popularity. Trump enters the Oval Office as the weakest new commander-in-chief in living memory. Having lost the popular vote by almost 3 million, he has no political mandate to speak of. And his disastrous poll numbers are hard to overstate. This is the high-water mark of every president’s approval ratings – before they do the tough stuff of governing and encounter one of the many fast-moving crises that pass through the West Wing. At the height of his popularity, Donald Trump is polling as badly as George W Bush at the end of his doomed presidency, after the catastrophic collapse of the economy and the bloody disaster of the Iraq war. A bumper crop of pre-inauguration polls tell the story of how deeply unpopular the 45th president is already. His personal popularity is as low as 32% compared to 61% favorability for President Obama. Approval of his transition shows him trailing Obama by an even greater margin: just 40% like the way Trump has performed since November, compared to 84% for Obama’s transition eight years ago. Even George W Bush, elected after the extraordinary recount and legal coup in 2000, earned a 61% rating for his transition. These aren’t trivial numbers. They are the white blood cells of the circulatory system that flows through Washington. Good poll numbers can inoculate a president when Congress opposes him. Bad numbers reveal a president vulnerable to outside attacks and embolden his many rivals both inside and outside his own party. Those numbers are about to get a lot worse. In his first year in office, Obama lost more than 15 points on his job approval. If Trump follows the same track, he will be polling in the mid-20s by this time next year. To put that into context, Richard Nixon’s job approval on the day he quit the Oval Office was 24%. And no Mr President, these aren’t rigged polls. The polls just reflect what people think of you, and they all rate you poorly both on a personal and professional basis. Here’s what’s rigged: an election you can win after losing the popular vote by more than 2 points, as the polls correctly forecast. What could drive Trump’s poll numbers so low? Unlike Obama, who inherited the worst economy in two generations, the incoming president cannot blame external forces. The greatest threat, both to his presidency and the republic, comes from Trump himself. Somewhere near the top of the list is potential profiteering from the presidency through his continued ownership of the Trump Organization. It seems Trump will be in breach of the government lease on his new Washington hotel as soon as he is sworn into office today. His efforts to hold onto the lease – which specifically prohibits government officials from holding it – will reveal his true priorities in office. According to his personal attorney, Trump has drawn an ethical line by appointing his own ethics officer inside his own company. This is a quaint arrangement favored by foxes guarding henhouses. The ethics of the Trump Organization are irrelevant; the ethics of the presidency, however, are governed by article one of the constitution, which prohibits gifts of any kind from foreign powers. Even under his own sham scheme, the new president has already breached his so-called ethical standards. “President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated,” Trump’s attorney Sheri Dillon told the press last week. “The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency.” This will come as news to the good people of Aberdeen who are about to witness the dramatic expansion of the Trump golf course in Scotland. That expansion, confirmed just this week, involves another 18 holes, a new 450-room hotel, a timeshare complex and a private housing estate. Trump’s staff brush aside these niceties by saying the Scottish deal is just a wafer-thin mint of an expansion of an existing deal. Sadly the constitution doesn’t distinguish between new and existing deals when it strictly prohibits the president from drawing any benefits from foreign powers. It just says they are all unconstitutional. What kind of deals might breach the now famous emoluments clause? As ProPublica has detailed, there’s the Indian deal in Mumbai that involves the vice-president of the ruling BJP party, who is also an elected official. There’s a deal in Bali, Indonesia, with an Indonesian politician, who has partnered with state-owned companies from China and South Korea. And there’s a deal in Manila with a man recently named as an economic envoy to the US by the murderous President Duterte of the Philippines. You don’t have to be a constitutional law professor to appreciate the legal and political jeopardy for Trump. President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about sex, a supposedly high crime and misdemeanor that is not actually cited by the constitution. Unlike making money from foreign officials, which is. Finally there’s the noose that’s tightening around Trump’s alleged Russian relationships. You know, the ones the new president said IN ALL CAPS absolutely don’t exist and never have, not ever, oh no. The FBI and five other agencies are now investigating whether Russia covertly transferred cash to pay email hackers in the United States as part of a broader Kremlin plot to influence the presidential campaign in Trump’s favor. We also know that counter-intelligence officials are investigating possible contacts and ties between Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian officials. Almost every scandal gets compared to Watergate, but very few genuinely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course, Watergate wasn’t potentially financed by our mortal enemies in Moscow, even if it did involve undermining a presidential election. The last covert plot between a president’s inner circle and an enemy state was Reagan’s illegal gun-running operation to Iran. Perhaps that’s what Trump means by stealing Reagan’s slogan about making America great again. Now that he’s the 45th President of the United States, the rules of this game have officially changed. Donald Trump cannot trash tweet his way out his problems any more. The constitution does not provide for that particular escape pod from Air Force One. The TV star is now the desperately flawed lead in a tragicomedy, the author of his own misfortunes. If our bodies are our gardens, this president has unnaturally orange thumbs.",2017-01-20T14:58:45Z,Opinion
83,trump,"Women's movement 'powder keg' ignited by Trump election Saturday’s Women’s March on Washington expects up to half a million people, as 1.5m around the world protest in support Donald Trump’s election has ignited a powder keg under the global women’s rights movement that will have far-reaching ramifications, according to organisers of a global women’s march due to take place on Saturday. As many as 500,000 people are expected to descend on the US capital for the Women’s March on Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration, joined by as many as 1.5m more marching in support in 161 cities across all seven continents. With marches being held in 61 countries from Germany to East Timor, organisers from Women’s March Global, the international arm of the Washington march, are determined to capitalise on the wave of activism that has attracted hundreds of thousands of first-time campaigners as well as seasoned activists. “The women of the world were sitting on a powder keg and Donald Trump just lit the match,” said Evvie Harmon, a Women’s March co-founder and global coordinator. Set up after Trump’s election victory, the global movement is being hailed as an unprecedented grassroots movement and organisers say it will have an immediate and concrete impact. Many international coordinators say they are marching in solidarity with US women, but that human rights and not Donald Trump are the focus. Cells set up throughout the US and hundreds of other places are plotting local campaigns, from preventing the construction of oil pipelines to outlawing female genital mutilation. They will be based around the “guiding vision” of the Women’s March on issues such as the rights of immigrant, disabled and LGBTQIA women and female workers. Individual groups will decide which targeted actions to take, Harmon said. “I don’t know any grassroots organisation that has grown to this size in only two months. There are now about 1,000 coordinators around the world. It’s too big and it’s growing too fast to control,” she said. “And we wouldn’t want to. We just want to support and help it to flourish.” Marches are due to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Erbil, Iraq where an organiser from Alliance for Peace and Human Rights (APHRO) said holding the march was a challenge because of tribalism, corruption and the difficulty of getting approval from the government “who deny that women have challenges in this Iraqi society”. “With solidarity we women are daring to stand up to the challenge of lack of salaries, terror, hate, exploitation, and trafficking,” she said. In the UK 25,000 people are expected to join the Women’s March on London, with another 14 marches in towns and cities across Britain including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Belfast. On Friday the campaign group Bridges not Walls unfurled banners with anti-Trump messages across bridges in British cities, and protesters on Tower Bridge in London held up pink letters reading “Act now!” Thousands of people were expected to gather outside the US embassy in the early evening for a rally organised by the Stand Up To Racism campaign. As many as 500 marchers could turn up in the small town of Shipley in West Yorkshire, in the constituency of the Conservative MP and vocal Trump supporter Philip Davies. “If we don’t raise our views, it’s like people with the Trump and Philip Davies view of the world have won … there is a good half of the population who don’t want that kind of world, and we have to speak up,” said Sue Easterbrook, one of the organisers. The global Women’s March, which also includes a Penguins for Peace protest on an expedition ship in Antarctica and a small gathering in East Timor, marked a dramatic renewal of feminist politics, said Sophie Walker, the leader of the UK’s Women’s Equality party. “People are realising that the time to act is now, they don’t have to wait for permission to tell the world what they want and believe in,” she said. Populist rhetoric had created a sense of urgency and desire for action, said Amnesty’s UK director, Kate Allen. “Human rights and women’s rights are hard won and at this critical time it is vital to stand together to celebrate our gains and against discrimination and division,” she said. “The politics of fear have no place in 2017.” Karen Olson, a global coordinator of the Women’s March based in Geneva, said the movement had “mind-boggling potential”. Technology such as the messaging service Slack, which enables global campaigners to connect in real time, and the reach of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter was “incredibly powerful”, she said: “We are building a global movement, not focused on a negative catalyst but on everything we hold dear.” Harmon, a yoga teacher before joining the movement as a coordinator, said she and many others were not prepared to stand down after Saturday’s protests. “If this doesn’t continue to grow it would be an awful waste of what we have accomplished,” she said. “I am going to be marching until we achieve equality. I’ll stop then, or when I die.” Why I’m marching Maria Kostaki author, 43, Athens While not a citizen of the US, I am organising this march in Athens because I believe the issues it represents are global. It’s about humanity. It’s about women’s rights, racism, equality, LGBT rights. I have a four-year-old son and I do not want him to grow up in a world where everything we have fought for is taken away. We can’t allow anyone to reverse what we have built. Lotje Horvers tour manager, 34, Amsterdam I want to be part of the message to the world that there are more people who love than people who hate, and I will not stand by silently while a lying bully is given one of the most responsible positions in the world. I cannot be at peace with the fact he uses his voice to set an example that it is acceptable to be demeaning to women and minorities. Rachel Druck rabbinical student, 31, Tel Aviv I am studying to be a rabbi and one of the major values of Judaism is accepting the other, making a place for the stranger and remembering once a year that once we were slaves in Egypt. Those values are propelling me. I’m marching because Trump ran a campaign of Islamophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and racism: to stand up and say he does not speak for me. Natalino Soares Ornai Guterres consultant, 27, Dili, East Timor I have been displaced from my home and have travelled to other countries (including the US) in search of better opportunities. Being a member of the LGBT community, I am involved because I understand the struggle that our mothers, sisters and people with non-binary gender identities have to go through in a patriarchal society. Aisha Ali-Khan part-time teacher and carer, 36, Shipley I wanted to show solidarity with the rest of the women all over the world. Women are not being heard by those in power anywhere in the world – if they were we wouldn’t be marching today. I’m a Muslim, of Pakistani heritage – this is not just a white women’s march, it’s all women, all over the world. It’s a really inclusive movement and it’s amazing to be a part of that. Shoomi Chowdhury Amnesty International, London We have so much left to do with regards to rights for ethnic minorities, particularly women from ethnic minorities, and not only is the potential for progress going to be lost, we’ve taken a massive step back. In 20 years, I want to be able to tell my children “I went out and marched the day after Donald Trump became president”. Nazila Kivi feminist magazine editor, Copenhagen I’m marching in solidarity with people gendered as women all around the world, especially indigenous, queer and migrant women, who are under a double burden of oppression. Women and our bodies very often become battle grounds for conservative and backwards ideas of nations, borders and racist ideologies. Solidarity and activism is all we have. Ritah Mutheu Muia entrepreneur, 37, Nairobi We march as the Her Voice society in Kenya because we stand in solidarity with our sisters from the US. We want to send a message that any act or policies that violate human rights or women’s rights will not be tolerated. In Kenya the fight against gender-based violence is far from over. As Kenyan women we have decided to break the silence.",2017-01-20T12:50:18Z,News
84,trump,"China urges Trump: be our friend, not our enemy Beijing and state media strike a conciliatory tone amid fears the new president could set the countries on a collision course China has urged Donald Trump to be its friend not its enemy, amid fears the tycoon’s inauguration could set the world’s two largest economies on a calamitous collision course. Since his shock election last November Trump has repeatedly put Beijing’s nose out of joint, challenging it over the militarisation of the South China Sea, alleged currency manipulation and North Korea and threatening to up-end relations by offering greater political recognition to Taiwan. The billionaire has also handed jobs to several stridently anti-China voices including one academic who has described its rulers as a cabal of despicable, parasitic, brutal, brass-knuckled, crass, callous, amoral, ruthless totalitarians. But on the eve of Trump’s swearing in, China’s government and state-run media struck a conciliatory tone with the man about to become the United States’ 45th president. “Both sides should try to be friends and partners, rather than opponents or enemies,” Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, told reporters. The Global Times, a Communist party-run tabloid, toned down its usually pugnacious rhetoric, telling readers it hoped the most “singular” president in US history would build a “better world” and “show a sense of responsibility that matches his power”. “The Trump team should project an aura of humility,” the newspaper advised in an editorial. “The US system advocates an assertive political style, but inner modesty is essential.” A leaked propaganda directive suggested China’s tightly controlled domestic media had been banned from publishing “unauthorised criticism of Trump’s words or actions” – likely an attempt to avoid further inflaming tensions ahead of Friday’s inauguration. However, the English-language China Daily took a parting shot at the president-elect, dismissing his team’s “war-like rhetoric” on trade relations with Beijing. “All the trade war threat to China is just the bluffing of a paper tiger,” it said. Scholars on both sides of the Pacific say they are alarmed at the potential for US-China relations to break down if Trump continues to raise Beijing’s hackles over sensitive issues such as Taiwan. “I guess you could say I’m despondent,” said Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University expert in Chinese politics and foreign policy. “I’m feeling very bad; not knowing where it is headed or if it makes any sense or [if Trump is] just following emotions wherever they lead … It makes me very worried about the China relationship.” Susan Shirk, a China specialist who served as deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, said she feared Trump had already anointed Beijing as the US’ “number two enemy” after Islamic State. “I don’t think we ought to prettify the US-China relationship in its current state. It’s got some real problems… But there are other ways of solving these problems than the kind of radical approach that Trump seems to be pursuing,” said Shirk, now head of the 21st century China centre at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s really a mistake to completely give up on any form of cooperation with China and to see China as already an enemy,” she added. “I don’t think he understands how much clout China now has economically and how much damage China could do to our interests and to those of our friends and allies if we provoke it unnecessarily.” Chinese experts also issued grim forecasts for US-China relations under Trump. “Conflict is inevitable,” Jia Qingguo, a Peking University international relations expert, told the Global Times. “If a trade war breaks out between China and the US, it will also be catastrophic for the US,” warned Wang Jianmin, a Taiwan expert from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. For all those fears there are still some who hope the deal-making president could still manage to strike up a mutually beneficial friendship with Beijing. “Nothing he has done suggests that will happen,” said Orville Schell, the director of the Centre on US-China relations at New York’s Asia Society. “And yet it is completely possible because he is such a contradictory person.”",2017-01-20T01:06:54Z,News
85,trump,"Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech Hopes that a new Trump might step up to the inauguration podium were quickly crushed under the fist of ‘America first’ As a man mesmerised by his own television persona, Donald Trump couldn’t stop himself staring directly down the lens of the camera poised to capture him just before he emerged on to the steps of the Capitol to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. “Hello,” breathed the star of Mr Smith Goes to Watchimself. Thus begins reality TV’s stunningly unsettling reboot of the fish-out-of-water genre. The president’s inaugural address sounded like it had been assembled from Donald Trump magnetic fridge poetry. Bridges, tunnels, “a historic movement the likes of which the world has never known”. It was as out-of-focus as his hair and served as an ominous reminder that that there is little so dangerous in politics as people who regard incredibly complex things as simple. “We are issuing a new decree: from this day forward, it’s going to be ONLY America first, America first … America will start winning again – winning like never before! … This American carnage stops right here, and stops RIGHT NOW!” Twenty minutes of that, and Barack Obama’s airborne departure had shades of the last helicopter out of Saigon. Washington had fallen, the new president very much wanted America to know, as he stood right in the heart of it and denounced its every effort. As he assured the crowds, strikingly diminished in comparison with Obama’s: “Now arrives the hour of action.” It arrives for the media, too, especially the ones who marked time in the buildup by asking: “Will we see a new Donald Trump out there today?” Guys, there is one Donald Trump, there is one speech. There is no fault with your set. President Trump’s demeanour was so openly populist and bullish that it seemed primarily designed to provide portentous establishing footage for future documentaries with titles like Dark Star Rising, or The Gathering Storm. So unboundaried has the president been in his years-long campaign to lower the tone that it was difficult for any of the speeches, prayers and readings given by anyone else not to sound like a veiled lecture to him. “Pray for wisdom.” “God blesses those who are humble.” May he grant you the ability to resist 4am tweetstorms. Some of the requests were so dementedly hopeful they could only have been included as a dare. “We ask that you give him the meekness of Christ.” But at this point we’d settle for the meekness of Kanye West. It was a day to be glad of the displacement rituals of protocol, especially if you were the Obamas. You come up the stairs. We shake hands. You stand there. Now we wave. I think you take the farther car door. You see – you just made it through five minutes without giving in to the impulse to mention my birth certificate or the unprecedented size of your hands. Only three years, 364 days, 23 hours and 55 minutes to go. A clearly inspired Trump manfully got through the swearing-in oath, even though he must have regarded the whole hand-on-the-Bible aspect as a conspiracy to focus global attention on his little paws. In the event, it was far more dignified than Mike Pence’s oath, which was punctuated by someone in the crowd screaming “LOCK HER UP!” And so to Hillary Clinton, forced to participate in the world’s longest loser’s reaction shot. At the Oscars, you only have to grit your teeth and grin for a minute when Liz Hurley’s name comes out of the envelope instead of yours. On inauguration day, you have to keep that going for hours. The camera trained on Clinton as she waited inside the Capitol, ready to be formally introduced to the crowds by the announcer, caught her taking in a huge breath and setting her jaw. Comic interludes? Trump failing to understand his chair-based dad dancing was bad at the Lincoln memorial rock concert on Thursday night, but more excruciating still when swaying and nodding along to the Mormon Tabernacle choir. Then there was the detail that portable toilets for the crowds were provided by the same local firm which traditionally does it, only this time organisers were so antsy that they covered up the company name on the doors: Don’s Johns. Pretty sure that’s not the urination association they have to worry about. There were also oddly touching moments – like George W Bush being unable to keep the pleasure off his face when Michelle Obama picked him out and turned the full warmth of her spotlight greeting on him. Certainly, it was the first time I’ve seen that smirk look endearing. And it was hard not to feel sympathy for Melania Trump, who still looks like she’s wearing a first lady costume, and radiated anxiety about not putting a foot wrong. In the end, for those on board the Trump train, the aggressive display marked the day the slogan could start becoming a reality. But for much of the watching world, it will seem as if the lamps are going out all over America. It’s unclear when we shall see them lit again.",2017-01-20T18:46:59Z,Opinion
86,trump,"A morning with 'adorable deplorables': why Trump supporters are optimistic On a bus bound for the inauguration in Washington, backers of the new president explain their views: ‘He isn’t putting people down’Full report: Donald Trump sworn in as presidentWomen’s movement ‘powder keg’ ignited by Trump election On the bus, in the morning darkness, Steph and Brandi put on their makeup, using a phone as a mirror. Stephanie Friess and Brandi Tillman have been friends since high school, and now they were on their way from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington to celebrate the man who had given them a brand new country. On election night, Steph stayed up past 3am to see Trump’s victory being announced. The next morning, remembering the night before while driving her car, the 24-year-old felt jubilant to be living in Trump’s America. The two women made matching Trump caps – blue and black – decorated with sequins and the slogan “Adorable Deplorable” in honor of the inauguration. Hillary Clinton had tried to attack Trump for lifting up the most “deplorable” among his followers: “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it”. Trump’s followers had proudly reclaimed the term, and now Brandi and Steph bedazzled it. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women will be marching in Washington in protest of Trump’s presidency in a demonstration called the Women’s March. While large majorities of black and Latina women voted against Trump and for Hillary Clinton, white women didn’t. Brandi and Steph are part of the majority: early exit polls showed that 53% of white women voted for Trump, including 45% of women with college degrees. The two women, both college students, were not entirely convinced by Donald Trump at first. But, Steph said, “he definitely grows on you”. Both friends say they appreciate Trump’s bluntness, his toughness, his lack of greed, and what seems like a genuine love for America. “He wants everyone to be successful,” Stephanie said. “He isn’t putting people down.” Brandi liked Mitt Romney, but “he wasn’t strong enough”, the 25-year-old said. “He wasn’t empowering us enough. He plays that innocent politician role that all politicians play. Trump doesn’t do that.” ‘A cake can’t be racist’ On the bus to Washington, many of the women’s fellow white Trump supporters expressed frustration at constantly being labeled racist. It was a term, some argued, that liberals just threw around whenever they were losing an argument. A local bakery in Pennsylvania had just produced tiny hat-shaped “Make America Great Again” cakes in honor of the inauguration, and a short post about the themed cakes on Facebook had sparked a long debate, with some commenters labelling the bakery racist, or saying they would not longer patronize it. “Why not a “grab ’em by the p*ssy” cake?” one commenter asked. Or a “deport all immigrants cake”? The bus supporters were indignant. They had won. It was supposed to be a day to celebrate. And yet the news was full of protests and threatened disruption, and even a bakery making an inauguration dessert had somehow become divisive. “A cake can’t be racist,” Dave DeFries, a longtime Trump supporter from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, said in exasperation. In the seat behind Brandi and Steph, Laura Ann, 34, who asked that her last name not be used, had bought two of them. She sliced them and handed them out. The cake was moist, the frosting tasting faintly of marshmallow. Laura Ann had voted for Obama twice. She worked in healthcare, and had wanted the president to fix the health insurance system. He had failed. She was still kicking herself for voting for him. As a gun owner with several AR-15 rifles – she found them light and easy to handle as a female shooter – she had also been frustrated by the constant attacks on “the so-called ‘assault rifle’”. “I’d really like to see [Trump] help the inner cities more,” she said. She thought Ben Carson, who grew up in Detroit and went on to become a surgeon, would be a great force in helping urban America. Eileen, at 46, had cast her first ballot ever for Trump. “I want the jobs to come back to America,” she said. Her brother, a systems analyst, had lost his job to workers in India and had been forced to personally train the Indian worker who was taking his place, under threat of losing his pension. Eileen also felt Obama had failed to bring insurance companies in line to bring healthcare costs down. Worried that her high school friends who voted for Clinton would attack her, she asked not to publish her last name. Many of the supporters said they had never been politically involved before Trump ran for president. Several had voted for Obama at least once. Some of the new activists said they were amazed by the energy of Trump’s movement. “It doesn’t seem like a political environment,” Dave Ennis said. “It seems like we’re going to a football game.” Some said that their friends or family were worried that something might happen on inauguration day, that the protests might make DC dangerous. One man mentioned that he had seen a video produced by the conservative provocateur James O’Keefe about activists discussing a plan to throw acid on Trump supporters. ‘It’s like, I get it, I get it, slavery was bad. I didn’t do it’ At the back of the bus, another Dave (who did not give his last name) sat opposite his wife and 16 year-old son, Brian, who he called a liberal “snowflake”. The two of them argued constantly, the father said, especially about Black Lives Matter. Brian said he believed that the Black Lives Matter protesters and the Boston Tea Party rebels were identical – except for their race. Protesters had to be loud to make themselves noticed. His father was more skeptical that black Americans were being unfairly victimized. His own interactions with the police when he was younger had taught him that when people chose a certain lifestyle, the police would target them – and there was nothing wrong with that. Brandi and Steph said that felt that racism toward black Americans had been given a disproportionate platform compared with other kinds of racism. They disapproved of Obama supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which they saw as racist. “Why is it Black Lives Matter, not all lives?” Stephanie asked. “I just don’t think most cops are out to get black people,” Brandi replied. “The media blows a lot of this out of proportion,” Stephanie said. “I didn’t think it’s bad that we had a first black president. That’s not bad. That’s great,” Brandi opined. But Obama “should not have been elected to a second term. I think his color had a lot to do with that.” In school, Brandi said, some black girls had bullied her, and when she complained, “my teacher told me to grow a thicker skin”. Asked about the systemic inequality black Americans face – in the criminal justice system, or in education – Brandi said that, because she’s been living in Delaware, a relatively liberal state, “maybe I haven’t seen that as much”. “I, like, see the opposite. Black people get free college, ” she said. “My mom’s a single mom. I’m not white privileged, and I’m sick of being told I am.” Both said that felt they had grown up and gone to school while constantly being told things “trying to make us feel bad for being white”. Slavery was a topic of discussion again and again, the schools focused on black authors, “it’s always black history month”. “It’s like, I get it, I get it, slavery was bad. I didn’t do it,” Brandi said. Brandi said she felt bad for her other minority friends – Hispanic, Asian, Indian – who also faced racism, but seemed to get less attention. Her Indian American friends faced job discrimination, she believed, by people who might not think they fit the look they wanted, or who bought into the stereotype that they might be terrorists. ‘I’m a little bit worried about the tweeting’ Both friends also had some concerns about Trump. Stephanie didn’t believe for a long time that Trump could really pull off a presidential demeanor. That’s why she thought Clinton would win. Brandi said she did not believe new environmental protections should be rolled back, and her stepmother had serious concerns about Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and school choice advocate whose understanding of basic educational concepts and laws came under question during her confirmation hearing. “I know teachers aren’t very happy about that,” she said. “I’m a little bit worried about the tweeting,” Brandi added. She was concerned, she said, that “he might say something …” “That he can’t take back,” Steph broke in. But for the most part, the two friends were optimistic that Trump would tackle the economy, create jobs, address cyber-attacks, and make America stronger. Brandi, who was waitressing as she went through college, said: “I’d like to see more money. I’d like to see more tips.” Neither of the friends had been concerned about his comments about grabbing women by the pussy. “That was 10 years ago, and people change,” Brandi said. Brandi said if a famous billionaire had tried to grope her, she would have sued immediately, not stayed silent for years until the man ran for president. “Damn straight, if someone gropes me, I would want to sue,” she said. Steph disagreed. She probably would have stayed quiet, she said. A Belgian journalist who was also on the bus then took his turn and interviewed the two women about their support for Trump, and asked them to comment on the fears many Americans have about the coming months. Brandi said her faith as a Christian kept her from being too anxious, and that Americans should calm down. Trump, after all, was just the president. “He’s not God. He’s not Hitler. It’s not the end of the world,” she said.",2017-01-20T19:57:34Z,News
87,trump,"Digested week: more tales of Brexit, Trump ... and Uri Geller In a week when Theresa May buried the single market, an old book is dug up that seemingly predicted the rise of Trump Monday I spent Saturday night talking about Brexit to a packed – since you didn’t ask – audience at the Ropetackle arts centre in Shoreham. Apart from being a very enjoyable occasion, it confirmed what many others have been saying: that old party allegiances are breaking down. Where people used to politically identify as Conservative or Labour – or in some cases Liberal Democrat or Ukip – they now primarily identify themselves as leave or remain. If this turns out to be more than a passing trend, it will make for an interesting general election in 2020. Most commentators have focused their attention on the Labour heartlands in the north that voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU and would be vulnerable to a strong Brexit Conservative or Ukip candidate. But there are also some Tories in the south who may have cause to be worried, not least Tim Loughton, the MP for East Worthing and Shoreham. Though Loughton had an easy win in 2015 with a 15,000 majority, things could get a lot tighter next time as his constituency voted 53%-47% to leave. When I mentioned Loughton’s role as cheerleader-in-chief for Andrea Leadsom to be next party leader, his name got boos worthy of a pantomime villain. Tuesday In 1988 Margaret Thatcher chose Lancaster House as the venue to praise the EU single market; it was no coincidence that Theresa May used the same setting to bury it. We hacks were cooped up somewhere in the basement for the best part of 90 minutes before the prime minister gave her speech. Not, it turned out, for reasons of security but to try to keep us from asking any awkward questions of the 27 EU ambassadors who sat stoney-faced throughout the 45 minutes May had their undivided attention. More interesting was Labour’s response. While Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, congratulated the prime minister on not taking the hard Brexit option, Jeremy Corbyn was berating her for turning the UK into a bargain basement tax haven. No wonder the rest of the Labour party weren’t quite sure what they were supposed to say or ask. “We weren’t given any briefing papers,” one MP told me. “When I asked why, I was informed that Labour hadn’t been given enough time to respond.” As most of May’s speech had been pre-briefed to the media several days previously, Labour politicians must have been the only people kept out of the loop. Wednesday When I was 10 years old back in 1966, my parents had a German boy to stay for the weekend as part of a school trip to our town. Before he arrived, my mum took me to one side and said: “When you’re playing war games with him, make sure you say ‘Let’s kill the enemy’ and not ‘Let’s kill Jerry’.” As much of my world view was informed by reading The Victor, War Picture Library comics, and watching films such as The Great Escape, this was probably good advice. At any rate, I managed to get through the weekend without causing a major diplomatic incident. Which is more than can be said for Boris Johnson, who used his visit to India as a backdrop for comparing François Hollande to a Nazi prison camp guard. While his remarks have been excused as lighthearted banter by the likes of Michael “With Friends Like These” Gove, it might be more helpful for the country if we didn’t have a foreign secretary whose understanding of 20th-century history wasn’t still equal to that of a 10-year-old boy in the 1960s. Thursday Much as I instinctively believed Uri Geller must be a charlatan when he turned up in Britain during the 1970s, part of me still wanted him to be genuine. And now it turns out that he just might have been. Recently released files have revealed that the CIA repeatedly tested Geller at the Stanford Research Institute between 1972 and 1976 and the Israeli spoon-bender kept passing with flying colours. Time and again, when locked in a sealed room and asked to draw the same image as a scientist was drawing elsewhere in the building, he came up with an uncannily similar picture.

88,trump,"US intelligence investigating Russian links of leading Trump associates – report President-elect’s team denies any knowledge of inquiries, which according to the New York Times involve ex-campaign chief Paul ManafortDonald Trump swon in as 45th president – live coverage Will the new president halt investigations about himself? Donald Trump’s transition team has been forced to distance itself from reports that American intelligence agencies have intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russia and associates of the president-elect. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as the 45th president of the United States, the business dealings of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort were among the matters under investigation, the New York Times reported, citing current and former senior American officials. Manafort, who stood down as Trump’s campaign chief in August 2016, has made millions from consulting work while working for pro-Russia oligarchs including Rinat Akhmetov, Dmitry Firtash and Oleg Deripaska. The National Security Agency has conducted surveillance of Manafort’s business contacts, the Times said, for suspected links to Russia’s security service, the FSB. Other Trump associates whose contacts are said to be under the microscope include Carter Page, an investment banker who worked in Russia and who was a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and Roger Stone, whose involvement in Republican politics goes back to Richard Nixon. However, the Trump team denied any knowledge of the investigations – which have reportedly been led by the FBI and supported by the NSA, CIA and the treasury department’s financial crimes unit – or why they might be under way. “We have absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation,” said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition. Manafort called the allegations that he had interactions with the Russian government a “Democrat party dirty trick and completely false”. “I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,” he said in an emailed statement. “On the ‘Russian hacking of the D.N.C.,’” he said, “my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the papers.” The reports follow weeks of intrigue over the possible involvement of Russia in trying to help Trump win last November’s election. A secret CIA analysis reportedly concluded that people with connections to the Russian government provided emails, hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, to WikiLeaks in the runup to the 8 November election. In December, outgoing president Barack Obama ordered US intelligence to review evidence of Russian interference in the election, although the Times reported that it was not clear whether the latest revelations were part of that review.",2017-01-20T04:56:34Z,News
89,trump,"DeploraBall: Trump lovers and haters clash at Washington DC event Hundreds of demonstrators gather to wave placards and shout slogans at the National Press Club where pro-Trump event held•Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage •Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day Chaos erupted outside the DeploraBall on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration as protesters clashed with supporters of the president-elect. “Nazi scum!” a masked man yelled through a police barricade at a woman in a sequined gown as she defiantly waved her ticket for the event. A woman held a sign that read “Look, Ma. It’s a racist misogynist” with an arrow pointed toward the guest line. In response a man flipped open his suit jacket to show her his shirt, which read: “Deplorable lives matter.” Hundreds of protesters filled the street in front of the National Press Club, the chosen venue for the DeploraBall, a name inspired by a remark made by Hillary Clinton, who referred to some of Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables”. Law enforcement blocked off the street to cars for the protest on Thursday night. Two rows of police in riot gear guarded the entrance to the club and much of the sidewalk. A number of the ball’s attendees were thought to be associated with the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US that has praised the Republican president-elect. The event has also revealed friction within the movement, as the DeploraBall’s organizers distanced themselves from the extreme elements of the group. The movement has come under intense scrutiny following a conference in December 2016 when Richard Spencer, the white supremacist who coined the term “alt-right”, declared: “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” and some in the audience gave Nazi-style salutes. The event attracted 1,000 of the president-elect’s most fervent supporters in an evening dedicated to celebrating “Trumpism” in the city he railed against. The dress code, according to the event’s website was “black tie optional – aka ‘fun formal’ – aka no rules”. From behind the police line, protesters flashed middle fingers and shouted obscenities and insults, calling the guests “fascists” and “racists”. “The red hats are better than white sheets,” one man said. “Watch your pussies, ladies,” a woman shouted at female attendees. The taunts occasionally turned to the police. “Who are you protecting?” the crowd chanted after the police cleared the sidewalk. An inflatable white elephant emblazoned with a banner that said “racism” loomed over the crowd. Protesters in hoods and masks set fire to a pile of placards in the middle of the street. Another group beamed floodlights at the top of the building to project the message: “Impeach the Predatory President.” Clashes broke out between Trump supporters, protesters and the police. At each sign of unrest a crush of reporters and onlookers rushed to the scene as officers barked at them to move back. In one skirmish a man was carried to the sidewalk by police after being struck in the head with an object lobbed by a protester. The impact was hard enough that the man began to bleed. After the incident, police closed the sidewalk in front of the press club. “I don’t think most of these people know what they’re talking about,” said Daniel, a Trump supporter, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of being harassed online. “It’s pretty ironic that they call themselves the party of anti-violence and free speech.” Sarah Coles arrived at the protest wearing an rainbow colored “H” pin. She had come from the White House, where she and a group of friends had “poured one out” for Barack Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden. Coles said she was heartened by the show of resistance to Trump. But she never doubted that America could elect a president who antagonised racial and ethnic minorities. “My family is from Alabama. They lived there in the late 30s and 40s. We’ve seen these kind of things happening,” said Coles, who is black. “But my mother told me: ‘The Republic will survive this.’ And I have to believe her.”",2017-01-20T04:19:48Z,News
90,trump,"Donald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the United States Trump describes ‘American carnage’ in dark inauguration speech in which he vows to transfer power from political elites ‘back to you, the people’Follow our live coverage of inauguration day President Donald Trump has set out a bleak portrayal of a nation under siege, vowing to end “American carnage” in an inaugural address that fired up his supporters but did little to ease the fears of American liberals or an anxious world. Moments after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Trump described a country in crisis and pledged an isolationist and protectionist cure, declaring: “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton looked stone-faced during the speech, while George W Bush at times appeared uncomfortable. But there were cheers from Trump’s supporters on a rainy National Mall in Washington. The crowd was largely white and notably smaller than for many past inaugurations. Under the dome of the US Capitol, the billionaire businessman hailed the “historic movement” that swept him to a shock victory over Hillary Clinton in last November’s presidential election, claiming it was unique in world history. Citizens expect great education, safe neighbourhoods and good jobs, the 70-year-old continued. “But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” It was a grim account of the most prosperous nation on earth from a man denounced by critics as an authoritarian populist. Trump’s aides had indicated that one of his inspirations for the speech was John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961. But there were closer echoes of a 1968 speech by Richard Nixon that described “cities enveloped in smoke and flame” and hearing “millions of Americans cry out in anguish”. As America’s political elite looked on, Trump went on to blame past US governments for favouring other nations at the American people’s own expense, from the military to infrastructure to factories. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” he said. “But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first.” For some, the phrase “America first” has disquieting associations with a 1940s movement that aimed to keep America out of the second world war and came to be accused of antisemitism. But on Friday the crowd, many wearing “make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, applauded and cheered. Trump continued: “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.” Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, Trump promised a massive infrastructure building programme including roads, bridges, airports and tunnels, potentially creating thousands of jobs and costing billions of dollars. “We will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.” Trump’s longshot candidacy has proved uniquely divisive ever since he launched it in June 2015 by denouncing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. He also proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and earned the support of white nationalists. His speech is unlikely to have assuaged the concerns of progressive activists who intend to march in protest on Saturday. “At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other,” Trump said. “When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. “The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.” Trump had said in advance he hoped to emulate Ronald Reagan’s 1981 inaugural address. And there were clear echoes in his blunt 16-minute address of Reagan’s creed that government is not the solution but rather the problem. “Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people,” Trump said. “For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. “The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. “That all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment, it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. “What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.” Trump lost no time in sitting down at the US Capitol to sign a waiver for his defence secretary nominee, James Mattis, as well as documents for his other cabinet nominations and a proclamation for a national day of patriotism. There was some light banter with leading Democrats over pens. The physical transfer of power was mirrored online. A “top issues” section of the White House website moved priorities of the Obama administration – including civil rights, climate change and the Iran nuclear deal – to an archival website and replaced them with headings such as “America first energy plan”, “America first foreign policy,” “Bringing back jobs and growth” and “Making our military strong again”.

91,trump,"On eve of inauguration, Trump addresses nation in shadow of Lincoln Trump spoke at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr declared ‘I have a dream’, and told the largely white crowd: ‘You’re not forgotten any more’Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage Donald Trump staked his claim to Washington on Thursday by promising to “make America great again” while at the feet of the US capital’s giant marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in a celebration of patriotic music, military pageantry and fireworks. The president-elect delivered a brief speech from the Lincoln Memorial, close to the spot where in 1963 Martin Luther King Jr declared, “I have a dream.” Trump told the largely white crowd: “You’re not forgotten any more.” On a cold night of heavy and sometimes heavy-handed symbolism ahead of Friday’s inauguration, Trump led thousands of supporters in chants of “make America great again”, saying: “And I’ll add, greater than ever before.” A spectacular array of fireworks shot into the sky and spelled: “U-S-A” as the Battle Hymn of the Republic rang out. Accompanied by his wife, Melania, and other family members, he then walked up the steps and spent the better part of a minute silently contemplating the seated Lincoln, the president who won the civil war and helped end slavery. His celebrated Gettysburg address and second inaugural address are inscribed on the chamber walls. Supporters lined the pool at the National Mall, many wearing “Make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, though the area was far from full and some left early as temperatures plummeted after dark. Nearby were the Vietnam war memorial and ghostly figures of soldiers at the Korean war memorial. But it was the juxtaposition with Trump’s fellow Republican Lincoln, the 16th and arguably greatest US president, that was most striking. Hollywood actor Jon Voight, a vocal Trump supporter, told the crowd: “President Lincoln who sits here with us I’m sure is smiling knowing we will be led by an honest and good man, who will work for all the people no matter their creed or colour. We will see a renewed America.” Some observers, however, found the choice of the Lincoln Memorial jarring. Keith Stiggers, 25, who is African American, said: “When I saw that I was like, wow! Probably a lot of his supporters don’t like Lincoln and his legacy for the country. Is he going to uphold that legacy or is he going to do what he can to step on it?” Stiggers, a law student, had come with his fiancee to support democracy and feels that Friday’s inaugural address will be crucial. “I think he should definitely build bridges. He got a lot of support from the ‘alt-right’ and now he should make it clear he is governing for all Americans. His speech is going to be very important; it’s going to dictate the pace of his presidency.” The free “welcome celebration” had begun just after 4pm with military marching, music and pageantry, including the national anthem, followed by a change of gear with drummer DJ Ravidrums (Ravi Jakhotia), who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner. Behind him giant TV screens flashed the names of every US state. There were performances from soul singer Sam Moore and an improvised country music group, laden with patriotism. Eventually Trump and his wife, Melania, appeared to the soundtrack of the Rolling Stones’ Heart of Stone. The president-elect turned to give Lincoln a military salute before descending the steps to chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” They joined other family members behind protective glass to watch artists including the Piano Guys – “It’s time to put all our differences aside” – rock band 3 Doors Down, Lee Greenwood and country singer Toby Keith, who was introduced as “one of the most popular artists in history”. Trump is said to have had trouble attracting A-list stars to appear at the event. Tom Barrack, president of the presidential inauguration committee, then introduced the TV celebrity and businessman turned politician. “I would like you to pay tribute to the courage, to the strength, to the loyalty of this man,” he said. Trump, holding a microphone in his left hand, thanked his supporters and said: “I’m just the messenger … It’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world, they say … it’s something that’s very, very special. The phrase, you all know it, half of you are wearing the hat: make America great again.” Trump reflected on the noisy rallies of his election effort, which few observers thought would lead to Friday’s ceremonies 18 months ago. “There was never an empty seat, like tonight,” he said. “We all knew that last month of the campaign … we knew that something special was happening. “The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us. When the campaign started I called it the forgotten man and forgotten woman. Well, you’re not forgotten any more.” The crowd cheered. Trump promised to bring jobs back, and not let other countries take US jobs any longer, while also rebuilding the military. “We are going to do things that haven’t been done in our country for many, many decades, I promise you.” Washington is a Democratic stronghold where Trump polled less than 5% in the election, but his supporters relished their time in the capital. Chris Lehman, 55, a maintenance supervisor from Belmar, New Jersey, said: “It’s thrilling to be here today. This is a historic event. We’ve got a president again who’s proud of the country and will bring jobs back to the country. It’s a good feeling. He’s brought jobs back even before he’s taken the keys to the office yet. Unfortunately he’ll probably spend the first 20 days undoing the garbage President Obama did at the end to slow him down.” Lehman, 55, booked his hotel in nearby Baltimore before the election because he was so confident of Trump’s victory. “You don’t become a billionaire by losing and not knowing what you’re doing,” he said. “He speaks his heart and he speaks his mind. You know what he’s saying is the truth, and you’ve got to love a president like that. He doesn’t owe anybody anything. He can come in and do this right.” Shannon Wilburn, 48, who runs a Christian youth centre, travelled with a friend from Roby, Texas, for her first visit to the US capital. “We just wanted to be here as patriotic Americans. It’s a bucket list thing to see a swearing-in of a president. I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian. One of the biggest things is his pro-life stance and, as a Christ follower, it’s very hard to accept someone who’s not.” Wilburn said she doubted that Trump will be able to bridge the partisan divide in his inaugural address on Friday. “They’re not even going to give him a day. Look at the Democrats boycotting it. He can’t get one day of grace. That’s a little frustrating, I think.” Nearly a million people are expected on the National Mall in Washington for a ceremonial transfer of power that will observe time-honoured traditions and pageantry but usher in profound political uncertainties. Trump has promised to shake up the postwar liberal order, issued contradictory policy statements and, even before taking office, sparked anger in foreign capitals with his volatile approach. Questions have been raised over the character and temperament of a man who boasted about groping women and still picks fights on Twitter. Protests are expected on Friday, and a huge women’s march is planned for Saturday, as liberals dig in for four years of opposition to Trump, who enters office as the most unpopular of at least the past seven presidents at the beginning of their terms, according to opinion polls. He also takes power under the shadow of Russia’s alleged meddling in the presidential election, which has led some Democrats to question his legitimacy. Up to 60 members of Congress will boycott the inauguration ceremony at the US Capitol. At least 28,000 security personnel from 36 state, local and federal agencies will be deployed for inauguration events, reportedly costing $200m, divided between taxpayers and private donors. Parts of the capital are on lockdown, with steel barriers erected on normally busy streets, to head off disruptive protests. Trump and his wife, Melania, will on Friday morning go to the White House for tea with Obama and his wife, Michelle, even as house movers work upstairs to swap their private possessions. The inauguration ceremony will begin with performances by the Talladega Marching Tornadoes, the Rockettes dance troupe, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old singer Jackie Evancho. At noon, in a scene not so long ago unthinkable to the political establishment, Trump will take the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. He will place his hand on his own Bible – a gift from his mother in 1955 – as well as a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration. In an operatic tableau, standing nearby will be Hillary Clinton, the candidate Trump threatened to jail during the campaign. She received 2.9 million more votes than he did last November but lost the electoral college. Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Jimmy Carter will also be present. Trump will become the first US president in the 240-year-old republic who has never served in the military or held public office. At 70 he will also be the oldest in his first term, eclipsing Ronald Reagan’s record. Barrack said Trump’s inaugural speech would focus on “the issues that unite us” and claimed that the divisions from the campaign would “vanish”. “What you’ll hear in his address is a switch from candidate to president,” he told the CBS This Morning show.",2017-01-20T00:26:44Z,News
92,trump,"Red, white and who? Trump inaugural concert features few A-listers The free show managed to wrangle Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down along with several second-tier acts performing for ‘not particularly diverse’ fans •Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage •Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day Stalwart patriotism, showy entertainment and flagrant nostalgia ruled the day at the “Make American Great Again! Welcome Celebration” inaugural concert in Washington on Thursday. The show, presented in front of the Lincoln Memorial a day before Donald Trump’s official swearing in as president, earned uncommon advance coverage for an embarrassing reason. So many major stars turned down the offer to perform at the event, it seemed like any critically respected, or commercially significant, artists would sooner be struck deaf than participate. One star who initially signed on – singer Jennifer Holliday – felt pressured by her fans to back out days before. The two-hour free show managed to wrangle several star acts – including Toby Keith – though they were mainly ones who appeal to listeners who live far outside the country’s largest cities, and whose music ranks low on the approval scale of the nation’s tastemakers. In that sense, the performers aptly mirrored the sensibility Trump so deeply tapped into. CBS correspondent Chris Van Cleef described the audience in the ticketed seats for the event as “not particularly diverse”. The free show began with the US army band pumping out traditional instrumental marching music, followed by The Star-Spangled Banner. More historic music came from The United Old Guard Fife and Drum Corp, who performed a medley of songs from the 18th and 19th centuries while decked out in period military pomp. The first pop performer to take part – DJ Ravidrums (Ravi Jakhotia) – stressed the athletic side of percussion rather than the soul or groove of it. The Vegas-friendly star, who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner, bashed a drum set sprawling enough to entirely entrap him while multiple screens flashed the names of every US state. A brief segment in his opening set interpolated America the Beautiful as if it were being performed at a rave. The classic soul singer Sam Moore, of Sam &amp; Dave, echoed Jakhotia’s song choice. He performed the anthem in a gospel-soul arrangement, recalling Ray Charles’s famous take on the song. Moore, best known for boomer touchstones such as Hold On, I’m Coming, sang the song gamely, first with a lone piano accompaniment, then with a fine gospel choir backing him. A cobbled-together group (The Frontmen of Country) also appeared, sifting together members of three second-tier Nashville acts – Little Texas, Restless Heart and Lonestar. They offered a medley of songs saluting great American places – three of them set in Texas, all of them honoring the south. The songs included The Bluest Skies of Texas, God Bless Texas and Walking In Memphis, a cover of the old Marc Cohn hit. The Frontmen’s set melded into a performance by 74-year-old Lee Greenwood of his touchstone God Bless the USA, which brought the crowd to its feet. The song implicitly presents patriotism as something disfavored and in need of defense against unmentioned foes. 3 Doors Down, the sole rock act to appear, qualifies for that genre to the same flimsy degree that Nickelback does. The band’s opening song called for people to “stand up and take back your world today” – a clear rebuke to the Obama administration. The Piano Guys struck a more conciliatory note, announcing at one point: “It’s time to put all our differences aside. When we do, it’s going to be OK.” Like Trump, the foursome rose to power outside the usual system, initially using YouTube as their path to success rather than the major labels. The act lived up to its reputation for squeaky-clean family entertainment, offering an instrumental take on One Direction’s bubblegum hit What Makes You Beautiful. For a flash of showmanship, three of the four members plucked the inner strings on the grand piano, making it seem less like a musical performance than a team sport. The show’s headliner – Toby Keith – struck a balance between outreach and outrage. At the end of his first number, American Soldier, a sincere salute to America’s veterans, he thanked the outgoing president, Barack Obama, for “his service”. But his four-song set culminated in a hit that represents the most bellicose brand of patriotism possible. Courtesy of the Red, White &amp; Blue (The Angry American) presents America as an engine of vengeance, with lyrics like: “You’ll be sorry that you messed with/the U S of A/Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass/It’s the American way!” During one long lag between the performers, the sound system pumped out recordings by The Rolling Stones, including (bizarrely) Let’s Spend The Night Together and You Can’t Always Get What You Want (which Trump had used during his campaign stops). Early in the event, one speech broke up the musical entertainment. Actor Jon Voight presented Trump as a victim of a “grueling year” fueled by a “barrage of propaganda” and all the “negative lies” fired his way. At an event meant to unite, statements like those could barely have leaned harder into America’s wide divides.",2017-01-20T11:24:44Z,News

In his inaugural address on Friday, the new US president said his arrival in office had “special meaning” because “we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people”. As many were quick to point out on Twitter, that line had an uncanny echo of one spoken by Bane, the masked villain played by Tom Hardy in Christopher Nolan’s 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. “We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you … the people,” Bane declares in the movie.

The horror that I felt when Donald Trump was elected has not subsided. I still cannot believe that a man who has shown such contempt for women, disabled people and people of colour could become the most powerful person in the world. I’m marching because my brother, the man whom I helped to raise and the person on this planet whom I love the most, is severely autistic. When I was at school, kids on the bus used to imitate the noises and the gestures that he made. Now the sort of school bully that I thought I had left behind will be president of the US. And just as I fought them, I will fight this. I’m marching because I don’t want to be alone when that happens. I feel a profound need to be with other people, particularly other women, who believe in equality, justice and human rights. And because the thought of dumbly watching without making my displeasure felt is too depressing for words. I want to stand in solidarity with women in America whose reproductive rights will undoubtedly come under attack. I want them to know that we are out there, thinking of them, and fighting for them. I’m marching because a man who is much, much more stupid than Hillary Clinton and millions of other women, has been granted the power he has, partly because of his gender and despite his designs on women’s rights. And I want the daughter I hope one day to have to know that I was not OK with that. That I am not OK with the continued abuse, harassment, violence and discrimination suffered by women. That I am not OK with this man’s indifference to climate change, and his views on race and incompetence. That I am not OK with the fact that the elite are already gradually normalising him. This situation is far from normal. It is distressing, and embarrassing, and terrifying, and I can’t just do nothing. That’s why I’m marching. Micah White: I’m preparing for the day after the march when we need to get serious about building a social movement I’ve been an activist all my life, but I am not joining the mass marches against Trump this weekend. This is why. Right now the biggest challenge facing American activism is not the size of our protests or the volume of our dissent. Instead, what is holding us back from winning is that even if, by some stroke of divine luck, our protests were to topple Trump, we have no movement capable of taking power and governing after his fall. Our leaderless social movements remain incapable of making complex decisions together. We can raise awareness but we are still unable to win elections. American activism is lagging behind our comrades in Europe who have built powerful electoral movements such as Spain’s Podemos, Italy’s Five Star Movement and Iceland’s Pirate party. Until protesters in America are backed by a credible movement that can win elections and govern effectively, our street protests will remain a performative temper tantrum, at best. How to win elections and govern is the essential challenge that every genuine activist must now turn to solving. In the weeks and months ahead, I’ll continue the revolutionary experiments that I’ve begun in my tiny town in rural Oregon. I’m confident that if the collective creativity of American activism is oriented toward replicating the successes of electoral movements abroad then we can pull it off bigger than anyone else. So when people ask me if I’m joining the Women’s March in my community this weekend, or if I’ll be flying to DC to be raucous with my movement buddies during the inauguration, I tell them the truth: I’m staying here and preparing for the day after the march, when the protesters return home and are ready to get serious about building a social movement that uses protest to sweep the midterm elections in 2018. I’ll be waiting for you. Mary Jane Wells: An inauguration ball gives me a platform to highlight sexual consent I am a British-born actress and writer whose recent work revolves around sexual trauma.

So when I received an invite and the opportunity to speak for a few minutes in front of a crowd of US military top brass and – potentially – President Trump, I was torn. I live in a Californian echo chamber, where everything was sunshine, grapes and pantsuitable possibility. And then Trump won. I decided, despite my violent opposition to all he stands for, to attend the ball. I am not a celebrity, my boycott would mean nothing, and personal politics are inconsequential when there is an opportunity for a conversation about sexual consent, vulnerability and addiction to power with the leader of the free world – and especially this one. This is about leadership. We need more women in positions of military command, and access to an independent justice system for military sexual trauma (MST) survivors. We need women in the army to no longer be blamed with the old boys’ club adage of “You know what happens when you put boys and girls together …”. With a weak commander-in-chief, the values that sustain a prepared, cohesive military force also weaken, while sexual assault, bullying and mobbing systematically increase. During my moment on stage, I will stress the need for an independent inquiry into all incidences of MST. The US army is the most powerful in the world, and potentially an incredible force for peace. How is that peace ever achievable with an inward-looking system that potentially demands reporting to your own assailant? But such peace is a pipe dream unless it is brokered first between soldiers on the same side. I hope the crowd will listen. Nona Hurkmans: Our banners tell vulnerable people they are not alone What’s the point of protesting against an American president in the UK? What use is it? The point is visibility. And the use is showing our support to people who feel nervous about this presidency. This Friday, Bridges Not Walls – a collaboration between different organisations and individuals – is dropping banners with positive messages on more than 100 bridges (or mostly bridges) across the UK and around the world. Messages such as “Build bridges not walls”, “Still we rise” and “Queer solidarity smashes borders”. The aim is as simple as the action: to let vulnerable communities and individuals know that we stand with them. And there are a lot of these communities: women, Muslims, migrants, people of colour, disabled people, LGBTQ people, anyone whom Donald Trump has mocked, insulted, threatened to exclude or shown a complete lack of respect for. The list is long. The message we’re trying to put out is that we’re here, we’re with you, we’ll stand up for your rights, and we’re not going anywhere. And this message is not just for Americans. This isn’t just about Trump. In Britain, we’ve seen plenty of the language Trump has used, and it’s had an impact. Recorded hate crimes in the UK were up 41% in the month after the Brexit vote compared with the same month the year before. And who’s surprised, with the kind of billboards Nigel Farage sees fit to put up – a giant materialisation of a Trump tweet complete with visuals. “Breaking point” indeed. Even Theresa May couldn’t do better than to say she’s looking forward to working with the man who once suggested a female political opponent was too ugly to be elected. With our banner drops on Friday, Bridges Not Walls hopes to signal to vulnerable people that this should not be the new normal. You are not alone. You can speak up. Because what happens next is up to us.",2017-01-20T08:45:20Z,Opinion
95,trump,"George Soros: Theresa May won't last and Trump is 'would-be dictator' Billionaire investor delivers bleak Brexit forecast at World Economic Forum and says Donald Trump is ‘gearing up for trade war’ but will fail•Donald Trump inauguration live: the world holds its breath•Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day Theresa May will not remain in power long as Brexit cripples her government, while Donald Trump is a “would-be dictator” who is “going to fail”, the billionaire investor George Soros has told the Davos world economic forum. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the “impostor and con-man” was “gearing up for a trade war” which would have “a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world”. The “would-be-dictator … didn’t expect to win, he was surprised”, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held. “I personally have confidence that he’s going to fail … because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,” added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Soros said he expected financial markets to “not do very well” because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration. On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union – and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled. “In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,” he said. “At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. “This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they’ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won’t rise as fast as the cost of living. “The divorce is going to take a very long time. It’s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.” Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce. The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force. May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with “determination and quiet resolve” to leave the EU but it was “overwhelmingly” in Britain’s interests for Europe to succeed. “Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country’s children, and grandchildren too. “We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.” With the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",2017-01-20T11:19:54Z,News
96,trump,"We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons There were hundreds of opportunities to stop the Republican demagogue. That should focus our minds as he takes the oath of office•Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage•Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day The road to President Trump was long and bumpy. There were many turns not taken, countless alternative routes that would have spared us this outcome. Instead, we kept going, corruption, infighting and sheer obliviousness stopping us changing course. What could have been different? There are a thousand possibilities. You could start with the long decay of the US news media into a branch of the entertainment industry, primed to seize on Trump’s celebrity. A wiser society would have demanded better, resisted more vocally, criticised more intelligently. Or the rise of Silicon Valley, its hypercapitalist, libertarian ethos helping to weaken traditional sources of information. We now suffer pandemic attention deficit disorder, fake news, hackable everything, cyberwar, and social media bullies, of whom Trump is bully-in-chief. An internet run as a public commons rather than an ad-driven free-for-all would have had very different social consequences. We missed that turning long ago. Or the erosion of civil rights. People of colour have been systematically disenfranchised by a series of interventions, including the gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Millions were effectively cut out of the election. Their full participation would have made Trump impossible. A renewed voting-rights movement will be part of how we crawl out of the hole we find ourselves in. That will have to include better voting systems and national voting-rights standards. The abolition of the electoral college also is long overdue; its peculiar mechanisms eked out a meagre victory for the loser of the popular vote. And we must undo the gerrymandering that so dramatically favours the Republicans. Or you could backtrack about 90 exits: imagine we had taken the dangers of climate change so seriously that, I don’t know, we had a completely different election about completely different issues, or the several such elections our environmental crisis actually merits. The road is perhaps too pretty a metaphor – call it a highway to hell and start looking for the off-ramps. We’ve missed enough already. This year, you’d be forgiven for thinking “left” was short for “left behind”. Many progressives got stuck in the primary stage, fighting Hillary Clinton as though she were running against Bernie Sanders, rather than Trump, all the way to November. Those who should have known better seemed unable to imagine that anything could be worse than neoliberalism. The Democrats bear responsibility for years of compromise and muddle; they floundered ineffectually while their rivals strategised with brilliance. They can do better – some of them have and will. The leadership shown this month by John Lewis and Barbara Lee, inauguration refuseniks, has been heroic, and the election of the Senate’s first Latina and second African-American woman were high points in an election that plumbed the depths. But more powerful Democrats could have worked harder to stop Trump, starting with the outgoing president of the United States. Barack Obama had all the intelligence information that was belatedly shared with us. He even used the so-called nuclear phone to call Vladimir Putin in October and tell him to stop intervening in the election. He had power over the FBI, and might have installed senior staff who were more loyal to the country than the Republican party. As it was, the FBI smeared Clinton and protected Trump. The latter’s triumph was made possible at least in part by our current president’s dedication to positioning himself above the fray, projecting Olympian calm. This was a season during which he should have been asking himself what Lyndon Baines Johnson would have done, back when the Democrats were fierce fighters. I turned off the radio after Obama said, in his final speech: “In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.” I yearned for a leader who would say something like: “Hey, there was foreign intervention in this election, along with voter disenfranchisement, so maybe it wasn’t free and fair. If there was collusion on Trump’s part, that’s treason, so we’re putting it all on hold and asking the supreme court what they think about all these unprecedented problems.” Obama’s statesmanly grace was, in fact, needless acquiescence. Other politicians, as well as ordinary citizens, tried to get the juggernaut to stop. Even Republican senators – John McCain and Lindsey Graham – demanded an investigation of the Russian business before the election, and several of the Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee asked Obama to release the classified information he was withholding. It turns out that a lot of people had material which they could have used to make a fuss before the election on 8 November, or before the electoral college met on 19 December, or before the joint session of Congress certified the result on 6 January. That day, seven Democratic congresspeople stood up to object, but no senator would stand with them. Later, Senator Dianne Feinstein said she believed that Russian intervention and James Comey’s sabotage changed the outcome of the election (and polls pretty much confirm that Comey delivered the coup de grâce). We didn’t need to know the minutiae of the Russian intervention; we already knew that it raised questions so grave that the whole transfer of power should have been halted while it was investigated. As it is, we now have an incoming president whose greatest commitment seems to be to Russian interests, including undermining the EU and Nato, and full-steam-ahead pursuit of fossil fuels. Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tyres and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are. That civil society has been galvanised is good news, though it’s hard to anticipate what the fights will look like: basic rights are at risk and pretty much the most destructive candidates imaginable for every cabinet position, from education to the environment, are likely to be confirmed. We need electoral reform to re-enfranchise people of colour and the poor. We need the wild-eyed young radicals to take over the Democratic party and make it reflect their hopes and dreams. We need smart strategists to make the most of the very promising rifts in the Republican party. We need to tell our stories better and learn to influence what stories get told. We need an endless series of reforms, from media and technology to education and healthcare. There’s more than enough work for everyone. There will be too much, and each of us will have to find a piece of the problem where we can be effective and stick to it. We’re going to have to build alliances – that means working alongside people with whom you agree about the big things and not quibbling about the little ones. We’re going to have to remember what kind of power civil society has and how to use it. We’re going to have to be brilliantly organised. Millions were asleep at the wheel; the shock has jolted us awake. What lies ahead is unmapped – but at least we are finally paying attention.",2017-01-20T06:00:01Z,Opinion
97,trump,"The President Trump effect may be a whole new British focus on Europe His views have little support here or on the mainland. But then, he is a uniquely American phenomenon, and most politics is local A cold January week has brought the west a chill new-year reality check. First Theresa May confirmed that Britain really is closing the door on the European Union not lingering by its fireside. Now, the stage is set in Washington for the words “I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear …” to usher America over the threshold and into the unknown. Later this year similar thresholds may be crossed in other lands. A Dutch general election in March in which the nationalist anti-immigrant Freedom party (PVV) may outscore all rivals and double its representation. A French presidential election in April and May, which the Front National’s Marine Le Pen may even win. A German election in the autumn where the anti-immigrant AfD, one of whose regional leaders condemned Berlin’s holocaust memorial in a speech in a beer hall this week, is expected to make gains. When future historians look back at these times they will not search for long before they discover that many in the west believe they are facing a general crisis, not an aggregate of local problems. The current level of UK media interest in French politics, for instance, is without recent precedent. It will doubtless have another spurt when the French socialist choose their presidential candidate this weekend and next. But the reason it is occurring is that observers sense there may be some connection between events in the UK and the US and the coming contest in France. In normal times, the British mind is shamelessly insular about European politics. Until recently, the only country that interested us was America, which we think is like Britain even though it isn’t. But that’s all changed. It’s an irony, as Jeremy Corbyn might say, that it has taken leaving the EU to make us more interested in Europe. But it’s true. That’s because all these events — Brexit, Trump, the coming contests in Europe, and not forgetting Scottish and Catalan separatism either — appear to be shaped by common origins from which no country seems immune. Globalisation, migration, inequality, stagnation, social media and disillusion know no borders. Opinion in the west seems launched on an age of rage. Historians — or at least people who studied history when I did — are familiar with the theory of a general crisis. One such theory was about 17th-century Europe. Events like the thirty years’ war in what is now Germany, the civil wars in Britain and the Fronde in France all seemed to speak of a social and economic crisis with shared roots, in which inflation and religious disputes were specially important. Historians like Eric Hobsbawm and Hugh Trevor-Roper differed about the extent to which the 17th-century crisis was economic or political, but not about whether it was an important question. In the end, though, the argument about any general crisis can only take one so far. In the 21st century, just like in the 17th, there are common factors that cross boundaries and there are echoes from one situation to another. Yet the differences also matter enormously. Why was there a revolution in 1640s England but not in 1640s France, when many of the same arguments and stresses were common to both? Because England and France sing their histories in different keys, that’s why. The same caution about borderless generalisations is needed today. This is true in spite of the fact that we clearly live in a period where democracies in many countries are failing to deliver sufficient fairness in the face of global economic and technological change. But they are doing so in their own distinctive national ways, too. The use of the term “populism” to explain this has become so loose that it actually explains less and less. It should perhaps be pensioned off. The Brexit vote is an important example of why this is so. The referendum was not called because of controversies about immigration, political elites or factory closures. David Cameron conceded it because he faced an obsessive generational concern on the Tory right, in the rightwing press and in some pretty prosperous parts of England, about UK sovereignty. The referendum was called for the reason that it said on the tin — the wish to leave the EU. When it finally came, of course, other issues such as migration and dislike of Westminster attached themselves with great force and opportunism to the leave campaign. That’s why May said what she said this week. Yet even so there was a very distinctively British and English complexion to the leave victory that has few real equivalents anywhere else. It’s simply not true, for instance, that Euroscepticism is carrying all before it in European politics at the moment, as Brexiters and parts of the UK press sometimes like to pretend. If that were so, Italy would never have survived the collapse of Matteo Renzi’s government following December’s referendum, Le Pen would be racing ahead in the French polls, Geert Wilders would eclipse all comers in Holland, while the rightwing Norbert Hofer would have swept to victory in the Austrian presidential contest last month. In reality, none of these things have happened yet. Renzi’s successor Paolo Gentiloni’s main problem is his own health — he has just had a heart operation —not the immediate survival of his government. Both Le Pen and Wilders are polling strongly, but no more strongly than a few months ago. Le Pen, indeed, is in some danger of slipping into third place behind the centre-left’s Emmanuel Macron in the race to the Elysée. In some ways it looks as if Europe’s democracies are managing to absorb these angers in their different ways, not succumbing to them like a row of dominoes. None of this is to predict that Beppe Grillo’s Five Star movement has peaked, or that Le Pen and Wilders won’t shake up their respective countries when the elections come. But it is to warn against the tendency to extrapolate from one country in the facile way of too many. Yes, politics is changing and yes there are parallels. But, no, this is not a general crisis. That’s still partly the way to look at Trump, too. Trump is a thoroughly American phenomenon. His only remote recent peer in Europe was Silvio Berlusconi, who can only be understood within Italian conditions and because Italy is a much more rightwing country than many like to pretend. No European leader of importance, not even May, truly embraces Trump’s ideas. Yet Trump matters. He matters because America matters. Since 1945 the US has been, as the FT’s Philip Stephens wrote yesterday, “Europe’s pre-eminent power”. Yet on every issue of international importance, from trade to Russia to climate change to international law, Trump’s views are at odds with those of European nations and peoples, Britain included. It is another irony that it may ultimately take Trump to make Britain take Europe more seriously. It is also another reminder that most crises, like most politics, are local.",2017-01-20T05:00:00Z,Opinion
98,trump,"Women will march against Trump. We may lose, but it’s still worth it We’ve been told that the Women’s March is pointless, confused, counterproductive. All the more reason to make sure we are seen and heard Women, know your limits. Thou shalt not halt the rhetoric of misogyny legitimised by the rise of Donald Trump by taking to the streets on your silly Women’s March. No, stay indoors! Just soak up this wave of misogyny because everything is lost and protests never ever work and face facts: one of the problems with this Women’s March (though everyone is welcome) is that it contains way too many women. That’s bound to alienate certain guys … I have seen such views propagated on social media. Basically, women such as me organising, resisting, coming together just for a few hours in many cities around the world to make themselves visible is somehow not the right sort of opposition to Trump. We have been patronisingly told that the Women’s March will make things even worse. For whom, one has to ask? We have also been told that now is not the time. I agree: we should have done this long, long ago. We could have read the runes; feminism has been demonised by the right as responsible for everything from unemployment to domestic violence for some time. Such a narrative is now mainstream, and we see to what and where it leads. This march, though, initially arose out of the fear and frustration of a grandmother in Hawaii. Her Facebook group led to the setting up of the march in Washington. Sister marches were soon announced in many cities across the globe. People, some of them women, clearly felt the need to organise, to mark what is happening and to make our voices heard. That is fairly simple. For some of us it is about showing international solidarity. But I don’t pretend protest is ever simple. There are always tensions. It is both an anti-Trump protest and a rally for women’s rights. These two things are intimately connected: Trump is part of a backlash against feminism that has been a long time brewing. Trump has no subtext. His hatred of women is overt. Women are property or ornament. This is not hidden; his appointments include those who want to roll back reproductive rights for the women who need them the most. His promise is about unabashed white power. His victory is a victory for overt racism as well as overt sexism. I wonder if those telling women not to march would tell people of colour not to protest? The criticism that the goals of the march are too vague has some validity, though actually the organisers in Washington have thrashed out a series of goals that try to take into account the complicated meshings of race and gender. This is not easy. Nor new. There will be those in the march in London who are uncomfortable with some of the others on it. There are groups supporting this march whose politics are very far from mine, but I will have to get over myself. So will everyone else. I have seen women complain that the march is too feminist or not feminist enough. Others have said that it’s pointless as we won’t bring down Trump. D’oh! Those who stir themselves, mainly on social media, to protest against the protest may think they are being iconoclastic but they are merely expressing their powerlessness. If voting doesn’t work and protest is useless, what exactly is the answer? Surely it lies in the relationship between the two, and that involves ongoing organisation. Any activist worth their salt knows that’s what the real work is. But protest is also a way to bring on the next generation, to connect, to mourn and then to find some optimism about where we are at right now. Out of fuzzy goals and all the different views there will be a pulling into focus. Sure, I remember the anti-apartheid marches with their clear and obvious objectives, but I also remember Greenham Common and the miners’ strike, which we lost. In both victory and loss however, understanding the power of defiance and collectivity is something to experience. Yes, that is old-fashioned, that feeling of solidarity, of walking beside others. The unfurling of banners and daft placards, the aching feet and children in pushchairs, the forging of bonds and the actual fun of protest. Some people will be there to make themselves feel better as well as make the world a better place. That’s how it works. One of today’s goals is surely to energise and connect women, to say to those who feel under attack: we are here too. You go on ahead. We have got your back. All of us have seen the disconnection of many from any kind of politics and also the disconnection between social movements such as Occupy from electoral politics. The prize is now to connect. Those who would take away women’s rights have already mobilised their anger and frustration and many have been slow to realise it. We now have to do the same thing. We will be seen and heard.",2017-01-20T16:35:54Z,Opinion
99,trump,"In pledging to put 'America first', Trump holds the world at his mercy The new president lamented aiding other countries at the supposed expense of the US, in inaugural speech that emphasised counter-terrorism‘American carnage’: Trump’s vision casts shadow over day of pageantryClinton stands stoic as former rival derides ‘all talk no action’ politics In his inaugural address, Donald Trump did not just promise to change his own country, he pledged to “determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come”. The 45th US president put the rest of the planet on notice on Friday that it would, from now on, have to deal with a United States that is far less willing to do things for other countries, buy their products or protect their borders. Trump pledged to “reinforce old alliances” but at the same time made it clear his administration would be less willing than its predecessors to underwrite the west’s collective security. While transition officials have been assuring US allies that American support would be undiminished despite the new president’s repeatedly voiced scepticism about Nato’s purpose and insistence that the country’s friends should pay more for their defence or risk forfeiting US protection, in his short speech in the rain on Friday Trump made it clear that the “America first” approach would be central to his foreign and security policy, in place of the multilateralism that was the hallmark of the Obama White House. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay,” he said. “But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America first.” It is far from clear yet what “America first” will mean in practice, but Trump’s campaign slogans suggest that a Trump administration would build up US nuclear and conventional forces significantly, but would be less prepared to use them to shore up other countries’ defences, or help bolster shaky governments and societies overseas. “We’ve made other countries rich, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon,” Trump said, reinforcing his previous insistence that Washington would no longer get entangled in “nation-building”, and deepening expectations that US overseas aid budgets could face drastic cuts. The new president has recently described Nato as “obsolete”, but there was no suggestion in his speech that his administration would leave the pact. Trump did suggest, however, that he would look for other alliances more exclusively focused on counter-terrorism. “We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth,” Trump said. The pledge of eradication is one that no US ally will take seriously. The fight against terrorism is expected to take decades, if not generations. Meanwhile, the mention of new alliances will raise questions about whether the new president will seek to rebalance the country’s foreign relations and seek new partners. No single foreign country was mentioned in the speech, but Russia’s presence loomed after Friday’s inauguration. Trump’s associates are reported to be under investigation in a multi-agency inquiry into their contacts with Moscow over the course of the campaign, and the new president was consistent throughout the campaign and the transition period in praising Vladimir Putin and defending him from criticism for Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria.",2017-01-20T18:03:08Z,News
100,trump,"The Peace Ball: black brilliance and resistance on the eve of the Trump era At the Peace Ball on the night before the inauguration, a stellar line-up of African American thinkers held out hope of unity in the face of fear The night before Donald Trump was set to become the 45th US president, I had a sense of dread akin to what I feel the night before an operation. On its eve, this inauguration felt like an unpleasant surgery to be gotten through the next day – except, rather than feeling like it would heal the patient, I worried this bloody procedure would kill the national body on the operating table. I passed this anxious period at the Peace Ball, a gathering of beautiful minds and activists which celebrated recent wins for justice and entertained possibilities for a better future. It was held at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (which should really be known by its better nickname, the “Blacksonian”). Before the apocalypse, being surrounded by Black art and listening to the wisdom of scholar Angela Davis, poet Sonia Sanchez, journalist Amy Goodman, novelist Alice Walker, Black Lives Matter cofounder Alicia Garza and playwright Eve Ensler seemed as good a way to kill the time and gird one’s loins as any. Hearing hyper-intelligent, super-activist thinkers giving rousing speeches (in a house dedicated to Black excellence) was something I desperately needed right before the storm. But that this audience knew how to get their groove on when the music played was just important because, as Alice Walker told the crowd (and as those queens who staged a “queer dance party” outside Mike Pence’s home on Wednesday showed), these times call for “serious dancing.” Neither Trump nor even Obama were evoked much at the Peace Ball. Instead, the party was a bittersweet meditation on peace through poetry, speeches and dance. I recalled how, just months into his presidency, the Nobel Prize committee had such high hopes for Obama as a pacifist that they awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize, inviting comparisons of him to Martin Luther King. Obama’s record on actual peacemaking was not Kingsian, though. Angela Davis told me when I asked her about his legacy that she was disappointed he did not fulfil a campaign promise to eradicate a potent symbol of American violence: “Ten years later, Guantanamo is still open.” Last year, the commander-in-chief’s military dropped 26,171 bombs abroad. Back in the United States – despite his task force on policing – Obama was unable to stop American cops killing more than a thousand people a year. “As we challenge police violence,” Davis told me, “we also have to challenge military violence,” both of which will likely get worse with Trump. Every cabinet pick convinces me that they’re ready to enact violence by reducing access to medicine, drinkable water, clean air, economic justice, and education. The Republican plan to reportedly cut $10tn in spending over 10 years will unleash enormous violence upon the most vulnerable. Davis told me she is “trying to retain a measure of optimism about prospects for the future,” given that “there have been many expressions of young people and older people who are clearly recognizing that if we are to survive the next four years, it will only be as a result of accelerated and intensified struggle.” Davis was just one of the peaceful warriors, mostly women of color, throughout the night who gave me life in thinking about how to face an angry, mean, vindictive, white misogynist. Amy Goodman took the stage to passionately declare this an exciting era to cover social movements addressing climate change (such as the press and water victories at Standing Rock) and the need for independent journalism and “a media that is the fourth estate, not for the state.” Sonia Sanchez rapped a poem that put Trump-inspired poetry to shame, remixing DuBois’ quote that “the cause of war is preparation of war” as “the cause of peace is the preparation of peace.” Naomi Klein said that Trumpism coming at us from many ways at once means “they’re going to unite us” and that “we have to fight these bastards as if life itself depended on it - because it does.” If Obama failed to have as much fight in him for peace and against white supremacy as we’d hoped, these women made up for it. Before I left the party, I wandered up into the Blacksonian galleries, which were quiet and mostly empty I lingered in front of Aaron Douglas’ 1927 painting, The Creation, which “depicts Adam from the Book of Genesis as a black man looking up to the hand of God”. But unlike Michelangelo’s early 16th century fresco The Creation of Adam the hand of God in Douglas’ painting is large, foreboding, high above and untouchable. Douglas’ Black Adam looks abandoned on the Earth – a sentiment I could empathize with as a Black gay man on the eve of President Trump. I then wandered over to Kevin Cole’s 2008 piece Increase Risk with Emotional Faith in which the artist depicts a tree his grandfather took him to where Black men “were routinely lynched for trying to vote,” their neckties tied around the noose as “a warning to other black men that African Americans should not aspire to the status or privileges of white people.” This work made me think there is little reason to increase risk for emotional faith in American institutions, as they have historically failed Black people– and soon may fail most of the 99%. Thank God, though, for the words of the peace warriors I heard last night – for dance, for the love of friends, for black brilliance and resistance.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you. Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us: “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.” We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",2017-01-20T17:01:21Z,News
102,trump,"Stoic Hillary Clinton looks on as former rival derides 'all talk no action' politics The former secretary of state had a front row seat as Donald Trump, a man she defeated by 2.9m votes, took the oath of office Donald Trump inauguration – live updates Full report: Trump sworn in as 45th president If she was thinking it should have been her, she certainly didn’t show it. Hillary Clinton stood stoic on Friday as the man she defeated by 2.9m votes took the oath of office. She was steadfast, just as she had been in the presidential debates where the soon-to-be victor, Donald J Trump, threatened repeatedly to jail her. She was not rattled as chants of “lock her up” emanated from the crowd below the inauguration podium, and betrayed no emotion as Trump, who defeated her with an electoral college win, declared an end to the era of politicians who were “all talk and no action”. The seating arrangements kept Clinton off camera through most of the ceremony, when the focus was instead on Trump, across the aisle, and Barack Obama, who sat one row ahead of her, to the right. After Trump’s inaugural address, the president shook hands with his predecessors, bringing him within inches of Hillary Clinton, but the pair were separated by a large man, who blocked the two from making eye contact. They eventually interacted with a handshake at the inaugural luncheon. Before the ceremony, cameras found Clinton backstage, taking a deep breath as she prepared to join the audience. As she waited for the ceremony to begin, Clinton spoke with former president George W Bush. The two later leaned into each other as they exited the main stage. Clinton adhered to tradition and attended the ceremony as a former first lady. She was dressed in a white suit similar to the one she wore at the Democratic convention last summer in Philadelphia, a time when she looked to be the favorite to win the White House and make history as the first female president. It’s seen as an homage to the suffragettes, who were encouraged to wear white at marches in the early 1900s. “I’m here today to honor our democracy &amp; its enduring values,” Clinton tweeted just before Trump was sworn in. “I will never stop believing in our country &amp; its future”. It is not the first time the losing candidate has had a front row seat to their rival’s inauguration: Richard Nixon and Al Gore attended their rivals’ ceremonies as the outgoing vice-presidents. And Clinton attended Barack Obama’s first inauguration, after he defeated her in the Democratic primary. The chasm between Trump and Clinton, however, was wider than those previous electoral rivalries. Trump threatened to jail Clinton during the second presidential debate. That same night, Clinton said that Trump was the first Republican nominee for president whom she thought was “unfit to serve”. Clinton is a former secretary of state, lauded New York state senator and two-term first lady. Trump has never held elected office. She was the first female presidential candidate nominated by a major party, while he bragged about groping women without their consent in a 2005 video released one month before the election. Addressing both Hillary and Bill Clinton at the inaugural luncheon on Friday, Trump said he was “honored” they even attended the inauguration. “I think it’s very important,” Trump told the luncheon. “And I’d like you to stand up. I’d like you to stand up.” The Clintons stood and were soon joined by the other guests, who applauded. “And honestly, there’s nothing more I can say, because I have great respect for those two people,” Trump said. Since her defeat on 8 November Clinton has been spotted walking her dog in the woods near her home in upstate New York, speaking to donors and seeing The Color Purple on Broadway with her daughter, Chelsea. Less than a month after her devastating loss, she resumed her political duties. She spoke at a portrait unveiling ceremony for the retiring Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, in December. “This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol I hoped to be giving after the election,” she said. Clinton left Friday’s ceremony amid a sea of former presidents and first ladies, waving to the crowd and smiling broadly as the ceremony came to an end.",2017-01-20T18:26:06Z,News

104,trump,"The new president can stop all executive investigations. Will he halt ones about himself? Donald Trump takes office when there is reported to be a broad investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and campaign officialsDonald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the United States How the Trump dossier came to light President Donald Trump takes office in circumstances unlike any in US history. He assumes executive authority, and his nuclear launch codes are being activated at a time when there is reported to be a broad, multi-agency investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and officials on his campaign. US intelligence agencies have already concluded that Vladimir Putin interfered in the presidential election in Trump’s favour. The night before his inauguration, the New York Times quoted current and former senior US officials as saying that law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of their inquiries. On Wednesday, the McClatchy news agency reported that the FBI and five other agencies had been collaborating for months in an investigation into the extent of Russian attempts to skew the election. The report said that investigators were examining how money may have been transferred by the Kremlin in its covert bid to help Trump win. One possibility was that a system used to pay Russian-American pensioners was used to pay email hackers in the US. Once Trump takes the reins of power, however, he has the authority to stop all executive branch investigations. He could replace the FBI director, James Comey, although it is highly unusual for a FBI chief to be fired before the end of his 10-year term. Bill Clinton sacked director William Sessions in 1993, on the basis of an investigation into his conduct carried out under George HW Bush into alleged abuse of office. However, barring evidence of blatant wrongdoing by Comey, any move by Trump to dismiss him while the president’s associates were under investigation would be highly controversial, akin to Richard Nixon’s dismissal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1973. Congress has also launched its own investigations. The Senate intelligence committee announced last week that it planned to interview senior figures in the incoming administration as part of its inquiry into Russian hacking of the election, and a subcommittee of the armed services committee, run by Trump’s Republican nemesis, Senator John McCain, is pursuing a parallel enquiry. On 9 December, McCain personally handed Comey a set of reports alleging the Trump campaign’s collusion with Moscow, compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, as part of opposition research conducted by the campaign, although the FBI had first received the reports months earlier. However, according to press reports, the joint investigation was launched before the Steele reports were written, and based on intelligence collected independently by US and allied agencies. The BBC has reported that the justice department was granted a warrant by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court, in October to monitor two Russian banks suspected of being involved in Moscow’s intervention. The issue of the Fisa warrant was first reported on the eve of the election by former British MP, Louise Mensch, on the Heatstreet news website. The Guardian’s own sources have confirmed the first application for a warrant over the summer, but not the granting of a warrant in October. According to the New York Times, the joint investigation into links with Moscow includes the former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who had a long history of working for pro-Russian public figures in Ukraine. Manafort did not reply to a Guardian request for comment, but told the New York Times in an email that the allegations of collusion with Moscow were a “Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false.” “I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,” he said. Manafort stood down from his campaign post in August, but one of his close friends has confirmed to the Guardian that he continues to provide advice to Trump informally.",2017-01-20T16:09:45Z,News

Trump, the oldest and reportedly least popular man to be sworn into the country’s highest office, takes over a divided country.

Last night saw fierce clashes in Washington DC in front of the National Press Club, the venue for the DeploraBall, an event hosted to celebrate Trump’s victory (with a name inspired by Clinton’s reference to Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables”). Many of the guests are believed to be associated with the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US that has praised Trump. Protesters were blocked by police but called attendees “fascists” and “racists”. Meanwhile, a host of celebrities attended a protest in New York outside Trump Tower. Alec Baldwin performed his Saturday Night Live impression of the soon-to-be president and rallied the crowd. Amber Jamieson has provided a guide to protests happening today and tomorrow here. DeploraBall: Trump lovers and haters clash at Washington DC event Pre-presidential party Trump delivered a speech on Thursday night in an event dripping with symbolism. Standing on the Lincoln Memorial steps, close to where Martin Luther King declared “I have dream” in 1963, Trump rallied the crowd with “make America great again” chants before a firework display spelled the words U-S-A, as the Battle Hymn of the Republic rang out. Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down performed at the event. On eve of inauguration, Trump addresses nation in shadow of Lincoln ‘We could’ve avoided President Trump’ The road to Trump’s presidency had many alternative routes but we missed all of them, writes Rebecca Solnit. From failing to address climate change to the capitulation of the media, Solnit argues, we’ve missed many off-ramps on the “highway to hell”. “Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tires and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are.” We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons Women’s March Come Saturday, a crowd of more than 200,000 is expected to descend on Washington to protest against the Trump presidency. For women who are on the fence, Lucia Graves has outlined 29 reasons to attend the rally on Saturday. However, not every woman was dismayed by Trump’s victory. Rebecca Nelson spoke to conservative women who are glad to see Trump in the White House and have no interest in protesting. Beyond the US, there will be solidarity marches held in more than 17 countries across the globe in protest of Trump’s election. A panel of Guardian writers have explained how they will protest from joining the UK women’s march to talking about sexual assault in Washington. While the march has gained international traction, Micah White, the co-creator of the Occupy Movement, said it takes a lot more than “raising awareness and getting media attention” to start a true revolutionary movement. In his piece for the Guardian, he outlines how the Women’s March could grow into something more sustained beyond Saturday. But it involves knowing one’s history, learning from the past, and taking the fight to the ballot box.

106,trump,"What you need to know about Trump's first speech as president Guardian US writers examine President Trump’s take on national security, the economy, climate change, healthcare, justice, immigration and gender Trump’s inauguration speech – full text The economy Donald Trump’s economic nationalism was on full display in his inauguration speech. The president spoke of the “American carnage” he claims has been wrought on America, leaving “rusted out factories scattered like tombstones” across a nation with “little to celebrate”, and blamed it on the outsourcing of US jobs. “America first” will be his presiding philosophy. Those people left behind by the globalization and the deindustrialization of America helped elect Trump and they will be cheered by his message. But who benefitted from this transformation? According to a report published in December by University of California at Berkeley economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the average pre-tax income of the bottom 50% of adults has stagnated since 1980 at about $16,000 per adult while the average pre-tax income of the top 1% rose from $420,000 to about $1.3m. The wealthiest 1% now owns over 37% of household wealth, the bottom 50% – some 160 million people – owns a mere 0.1%. Trump’s supporters can blame outside forces for their feelings of economic insecurity but it is people like Trump and his cabinet, set to be the richest in history, who have been the main beneficiary of the economic forces that have reshaped America. Trump’s supporters will have to trust them to work against their own interests if they want to Make America Great Again. Dominic Rushe Justice Trump continued to position himself as a “law and order” president, painting a stark image of a country ridden with “the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential”. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he pledged. Obama spent the past two and a half years trying to delicately push forward both gun control laws and a fraught debate over how to reduce police violence towards black Americans. He repeatedly emphasized the good work of most police officers, but also refused to dismiss the mistrust and frustration many black Americans feel towards law enforcement. Trump, in contrast, has put himself and his administration squarely in the camp of police unions, who have literally turned their backs when leaders like New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio have decided to treat black American’s concerns about police brutality seriously. Trump famously claimed during the campaign that Chicago police could stop the city’s sudden spike in gun violence “in one week” by “being very much tougher”. “Using tough police tactics,” was the key, he said, “which is OK when people are being killed”. After years of record lows in murder and violent crime, the United States saw a troubling 10.8% uptick in murders in 2015 – the biggest single-year increase in decades, though one that left the number of murders roughly the same they had been in 2009. Experts say it’s too soon to know how serious this increase might be – much less what has caused it. But Trump has selectively taken the worst statistics and waved them like a bloody flag. The new president has made clear that he will take a tough-on-crime stance. despite the building bipartisan consensus that a less-punitive, less-costly criminal justice system is likely to make Americans safer. Lois Beckett National security Of all the striking moments in Donald Trump’s caustic inaugural address, few were more discordant than a president whose associates are under investigation for their connections to a foreign power using “America first” as a slogan. The intelligence agencies that Trump has been feuding with since his electoral victory have concluded Russia interfered in the election for his benefit. They have sought a foreign-intelligence surveillance warrant to examine his associates’ connections to Russia and reportedly are combing through foreign communications and financial transaction records to that end. Additionally, the Senate intelligence committee has initiated an inquiry into the same subject, and has signaled its willingness to subpoena Trump aides. The course of those inquiries will be the backdrop under which Trump conducts US foreign policy and stewards its national security. In his address, which portrayed him as leading the nation out of an era of “American carnage” unleashed by parasitic elites, Trump beat a loud nationalist drum. Every foreign capital will soon learn, “it’s only going to be America first”, Trump said. His only sop to a universalist vision of America was to say that every nation has the right to similarly place their interests first. Trump alluded to forging new alliances – a seeming reference to his oft-stated desire to bring the US closer to Russia – in order to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.” While moments earlier, Trump lamented the loss of “trillions of dollars” through wasteful foreign conflicts, he set a rhetorical commitment to an expansive war against an undifferentiated adversary. For years, the far right has argued that only a willingness to blame an amorphous concept called “radical Islam” – often conflated with Islam itself, and understood that way by millions of Muslims in the US and worldwide – can precipitate a victorious conclusion to the 9/11 era. They are about to have their test case in president Trump. “It’s going to be America first” is a statement that conceals more than it reveals, particularly on national security. While Trump offered few specifics, he criticized the US “subsidiz[ing] the armies of foreign countries while allowing the depletion of our own military”. That “subsidy” is the “by, with and through” approach to training foreign militaries that gave Barack Obama’s Pentagon an alternative to the ponderous ground warfare Trump first embraced in Iraq and then repudiated. Several of those armies, including Kurdish peshmerga irregulars, Iraqi soldiers, Syrian rebels and Libyan government forces – Muslims all – comprise the forces fighting the Islamic State across Mosul, on the approaches to Raqqa and in Sirte. An early test of Trump’s stewardship will come when he decides whether to revoke such subsidies or jettison his inaugural rhetoric. Spencer Ackerman Health Trump was inaugurated with just a nod to one promise he campaigned on – making America’s healthcare great again. Though Trump devoted portions of his dark speech to crime, trade, immigration, jobs and even gangs, his only reference to American’s struggles to afford their healthcare was a promise to “to free the Earth from the miseries of disease”. However, if the new president is interested in fulfilling promises to listen to the American people made during his speech, he might take a second look at Congressional Republican’s plan to repeal Barack Obama’s signature health law, the Affordable Care Act. Only 20% of the public wants Congress to repeal the ACA without a replacement in hand, according to a January Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Another 47% don’t want the law repealed at all, and a remaining 28% want a plan first. But, so far, Republicans have been coy with details. Trump’s speech did touch on one specific health problem: addiction. “The crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential,” said Trump. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” In fact, there is one significant reform that helped cover millions of Americans’ addiction treatment – the Affordable Care Act. Jessica Glenza Climate Unsurprisingly given its anonymity during the election, there was no mention of climate change or the environment in Donald Trump’s inauguration speech. He mentioned mountains and oceans, but only in context of locations in America that will be great again once he solves all of its maladies. Trump did mention the US foolishly spending “trillions of dollars overseas” which partly references climate spending that the new president wants to axe. Barack Obama managed to push $500m out of the door for developing countries threatened by rising seas and droughts in his final week in office. Further assistance is now unlikely. Most telling was what was happening off-stage. The White House website’s expansive section on climate change has now been deleted. In its stead is an “America first energy plan” in which Trump promises to scrap the “harmful and unnecessary” climate action plan. This move, as well as Trump’s speech, is a clear indication the president will simply ignore climate change, as if it does not exist, during his term. Oliver Milman Immigration President Trump referred to border protection three times throughout his short inauguration speech, a sure sign of the emphasis he will place upon it as he attempts to enforce the draconian immigration reforms he pledged on the campaign trail. “We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own,” Trump said. Critics would argue the remark is patently false. The Obama administration deported more undocumented immigrants than any before it, and took significant measures to secure America’s southern border. Now the majority of migrants crossing the southern border come from Central America, many of whom are women and children seeking asylum from violence and instability in the region. Trump has also pledged to suspend America’s intake of Syrian refugees, who are already subjected to substantial security vetting before they enter the country, and it seems likely the president will move forward with this promise within the next few days. Coupled with Trump’s infamous promise to erect a wall across the entire southern border, it remains unclear just how much damage he will do to some of the world’s most vulnerable people in the name of border defense. Oliver Laughland Gender Trump didn’t mention gender issues in his inaugural speech. But in the days leading up to his swearing-in, his transition team unveiled a plan to eliminate $480m in Violence Against Women grants and his nomination for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, refused to commit to upholding the Obama administration’s aggressive stance on campus sexual assault or the rights of trans students. Republicans in Congress have moved swiftly to repeal Obamacare, which expanded contraception access and prohibited insurers from charging women more for health care, and to cut off Planned Parenthood’s participation in Medicaid.

107,trump,"The new first family: what you need to know about the Trumps Here are the essential things to know about the Trumps, with notes on the roles each family member may play in the administration•Donald Trump inauguration: the world holds its breath – live coverage •Inauguration day schedule: our guide to the day As soon as Donald Trump takes the oath of office, the Obama family is scheduled to board a helicopter for the airport and a California holiday. A new first family will have taken their place. Here’s a bit about the Trumps, with notes on the roles each family member may play in the administration. Melania Trump, 46 Wife of Donald. Born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia in eastern Europe, she was sufficiently successful as a model that she sometimes worked under only her first name, and toiled as an undocumented immigrant in the United States before landing a work visa in 1997, according to an Associated Press investigation. She met her future husband at a Fashion Week party in New York City. The couple will celebrate their 12th anniversary on 22 January, two days after he becomes president. She has said that as first lady she would like to be “very traditional – like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy”. She also plans to combat online bullying and harassment. She will remain in New York City through the end of the school year with her son with Trump, Barron, 10, and is expected to play a minimal role in the administration. Donald Trump Jr, 39 Donald Trump’s eldest son, he is himself a father of five, with his wife, Vanessa Kay Haydon, a former model. A reality TV star (The Apprentice) like his father, he has been tapped to head the Trump Organization – the family business empire – with his brother, Eric, aided by a longtime company executive. Trump Jr is not expected to have a role in his father’s administration; indeed, his new position as co-head of the Trump Organization would seem to preclude, under ethics rules and traditions, his speaking with his father about the business and his hearing from his father about government. Trump Jr drew ire during the campaign for agreeing to an interview with a prominent white nationalist and for comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles. He is a big-game hunter and self-described “boob guy”. Eric Trump, 33 Trump’s second-oldest son, he has also appeared on The Apprentice and is married to Lara Trump, née Yunaska, a fitness trainer and TV producer. With his brother, Don Jr, Eric is to lead the Trump Organization, and is due to have no role in the Trump administration. He runs a charitable foundation to fight childhood cancer, but claims he has made about his father personally donating large sums to the foundation, like many Trump family claims about charitable giving, could not be verified. Like his brother, he is a big-game hunter. Ivanka Trump, 35 Trump’s eldest daughter, and like Don Jr and Eric the daughter of her father’s first wife Ivana, a Czech-born former fashion model. Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism to marry businessman Jared Kushner, with whom she has three children. She is a fashion executive and like her brothers has appeared on The Apprentice. As an executive with the Trump organization, she managed projects including the recently opened Trump hotel in the Old Post Office building in downtown Washington DC, but she has said she will divest from the family company, owing to her husband’s role in the Trump administration. The nature of her divestment is not clear; it has been described by Trump transition officials as “converting” her equity into fixed payments. Ivanka Trump has rebutted speculation that she would act as a de facto first lady. “I think it’s an inappropriate observation,” she told ABC News. “There is one first lady, and she’ll do remarkable things.” Jared Kushner, 36 Husband of Ivanka Trump. Raised in New Jersey and the grandchild of Holocaust survivors, he has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a law degree from New York University. He took over his family’s real estate firm after his father was imprisoned on a federal felony conviction for witness tampering and tax evasion. Kushner is also owner and publisher of the New York Observer, and has said he is in the process of withdrawing from both the real estate firm and the newspaper as part of his transition to senior adviser to his father-in-law. Despite his lack of political experience, he played a key behind-the-scenes role in Trump’s presidential campaign, guiding personnel and strategy decisions, and will play the role of senior adviser to the president in the Trump White House, presuming he is not found to have breached federal anti-nepotism laws. Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump Maples, 53, a former model and actress, is Trump’s second wife and the mother of his fourth child, Tiffany, 23. Maples is now an activist and singer-songwriter, while Tiffany is a recent college graduate. Neither is expected to have a role in the Trump administration.",2017-01-20T11:23:48Z,News
108,trump,"'I feel nauseous': undocumented students fearful after Trump's speech Reaction to inauguration speech trumpeting ‘America first’ was met with mixed reviews across the country, with some cheering him for touting ‘the right way’Donald Trump inauguration – live coverage Miriam Avilez hid her face in her hands as she watched Donald Trump begin to deliver his inauguration speech on a laptop. “I feel nauseous. I can’t look at him,” said Avilez, a 27-year-old undocumented student. “Everything we’ve fought for, all the victories we’ve had, in one day are basically taken away.” Avilez gathered with other immigrant student activists at the University of California, Berkeley, on Friday to prepare for a morning of “teach-ins” aimed at organizing against Trump and his “harmful” agenda. Crowded inside a diversity office at the school of public health, the students, including some who are undocumented and have relied on the protections of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, were near tears after Trump’s speech ended. “I felt like he wasn’t talking me, he wasn’t talking about my family, he wasn’t talking about my community,” said Johanna Figueroa, 25. “Who are you talking to? Who are you representing?” At Trump Cafe in Bellville, Texas, a self-described American-born Hispanic woman took a different view of Trump’s immigration rhetoric. “I feel for all [immigrants], but there’s a right way and a wrong way and that’s what I feel he’s trying to make Americans understand,” said Linda Myers, 66, a small-business owner. Myers, wearing a stars and stripes flag as a scarf, said Trump’s speech was “very, very moving. If it doesn’t bring our country together, I don’t think there’s anything that can be done. It was moving, it hit where it needed to hit.” Myers sat with other patrons who piled in to eat lunch, watch the inauguration on television and buy Trump-themed merchandise at the establishment owned by Muslim immigrants. Tables in the function room were laid out ready for two large parties of celebrating Trump supporters. The owners, from Jerusalem, emigrated separately to the US and met in Chicago. About two weeks before the presidential election in November, they renamed their small-town Texas cafe in honor of Donald Trump. After the change, Eddie Hawa, 46, said he had some critical, even threatening, phone calls from people from outside Texas – but the locals in this county of fewer than 30,000 people, an hour’s drive west of Houston, were overwhelmingly supportive. Trump won here with 79% of the vote. “He’s a businessman and we need businessmen,” said Su Hawa, 28. “He’s a smart man, he’s very smart. I’m so glad he’s right now our president, I’m so excited.” But as Muslims, are they not worried by talk that Trump may institute a registry or travel ban? “He was talking in general, not individual people. I think what he’s saying, any president would say it – anybody who comes to the United States, you have to go through the system to become a citizen or resident,” Eddie Hawa said. “He was talking about Isis, he wasn’t talking about people living here.” Many opponents made it a point to boycott watching the inauguration altogether, whether because they were outside protesting or just watching another channel, hoping to drive down Trump’s television ratings. “I for one am actively not watching it. And what I mean by actively not watching it, I’m going to be turning on something else,” said Floyd Rumohr, who heads of the Brooklyn Community Pride Center in New York. Janson Wu, the executive director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders (Glad), was at the Creating Change Conference in Philadelphia during the inauguration ceremony. The conference is held at a hotel, and Wu said the inauguration was nearly impossible to avoid on the televisions there, but he was choosing not to watch. “Being among such a diverse group of activists and advocates reminds me of why we do this work and gives me energy to go forward,” he said. “I can’t imagine anywhere else I’d rather be on inauguration day.” In Atlanta, Georgia, protestors said they would rely on news reports to learn about what Trump said, but would stop short of watching the man talk. “No, I won’t watch it,” said Patricia Cofie, unemployed. “I’ll watch the news. That’s about as much as I can take.” In Berkeley, Sofia Villagomez, 23, said it was a struggle to force herself to even watch the event. “God help us all,” said the public health student, part of a group called Borders and Bodies Collective. “I’m just feeling like I need to be informed about what’s going as much as what’s happening just pains me. We’re headed for a fight, for sure.” Gladis Chavez, a 26-year-old undocumented student, said the reports that Trump may immediately repeal Daca, which could put students like her at risk of deportation, were heavily weighing on her. “It really scares me. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I lose everything I’ve been working for.”. Since the election, activists at the University of California’s progressive Berkeley campus – famous for its 1960s civil rights protests known as the free speech movement – have pressured the university to be a “sanctuary” for undocumented people. “Our lives were just used for political gain,” said Chavez, who was born in Mexico and came to the US aged two. “Our lives are just not valued. We’re all under attack. I feel like I’ve done everything I can do to show I belong here.”",2017-01-20T20:33:22Z,News
109,trump,"What's inside the Tiffany box? Imagining Melania Trump's gift to the Obamas What did the new first lady give to Barack and Michelle Obama shortly before her husband was sworn in as president? Here are some possible options Melania Trump turned up at the White House on inauguration day clutching a gift for the outgoing president and first lady, that recognizable robin egg blue box with a white ribbon signifying a purchase from Tiffany &amp; Co. Tiffany &amp; Co have a store in the lobby of Manhattan’s Trump Tower, so it’s an unsurprising store choice from the Trumps. She gave the gift to Michelle Obama, who graciously accepted it, before an aide took it away. But what could be inside the box? Tiffany said in a statement: “The White House has been a patron of the House of Tiffany &amp; Co since Abraham Lincoln,” which doesn’t answer our question. So here are some possible options from their online store. U-shaped key ring - $3,000 A $3,000 key ring to store the keys for the Obamas’ new Washington home, in the same neighborhood as favorite Trump daughter Ivanka. Gaudy and cliched (it’s one of Tiffany’s most famous items), making it a likely option. Vegetable spoon – $350 A silver spoon, just like the one Trump was born with! Plus, it’s a vegetable spoon to keep Mobama happy. Airplane bank – $2,500 To help the Obamas save up for their own personal jet, since they have now lost Air Force One. Plus, a $2,500 piggy bank makes about as much logical sense as a man with no government experience becoming president. Fifth Ave mug – $25 So that every morning over coffee, the Obamas can remember where the White House is located now. Ship’s clock – $2,800 A clock in Trump’s favorite hue, to help them count down the hours until this is all over. Tiffany playing cards – $35 Obama calls himself a “pretty good poker player” and now he’ll have lots of time to practice. The black and white cards may have some symbolic value. Elephant moneybank – $25 To remind Obama of how much money he had to save after the Republicans left the country penniless last time they were in control. Pineapple Dish – $350 A pineapple dish as a tribute to Obama’s home state … Kenya. Canned pineapple is the country’s largest single manufactured export, making this an appropriate gift from the man who led the Birther movement. Hawaii has a lot of pineapples, too, so Trump can tell the media that’s what he was alluding to.",2017-01-20T19:29:05Z,News
110,trump,"The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s inauguration: a declaration of political war The presidential handover observed all the usual civilities, but the tone of Trump’s speech marked a frightening change in America In its outward details, the orderly transfer of American presidential power accomplished in the inauguration-day scene on Capitol Hill today felt time-honoured. The ceremonial essentials of the occasion – the stars and stripes banners, the dignitaries and the prescribed rituals of the swearings-in – were familiar and traditional. Political rivals took their places on the podium as they do every four years, shook hands and applauded one another, offering gracious compliments and providing a show of national dignity. Yet all this was in fact a sham. Donald Trump’s inaugural address was a declaration of war on everything represented by these choreographed civilities. President Trump – it’s time to begin to get used to those jarringly ill-fitting words – did not conjure a deathless phrase for the day. His words will not lodge in the brain in any of the various uplifting ways that the likes of Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy or Reagan once achieved. But the new president’s message could not have been clearer. He came to shatter the veneer of unity and continuity represented by the peaceful handover. And he may have succeeded. In 1933, Roosevelt challenged the world to overcome fear. In 2017, Mr Trump told the world to be very afraid. Mr Trump’s speech was by turns bitter, blowhard and banal. It boiled with resentment and contempt for politics, and the checks and balances of the US system. It was aimed at those who voted for him, not at those, the majority, who did not. It said barely a word about race. Its America First nationalism was crude and shameless. The speech seethed with scorn for everything about the capital city that he now seeks to bend to his will. It was, though, almost wholly empty of detail or of clarity about how its goals would be achieved. Even before he opened his mouth, Washington was on edge about what a Trump presidency might mean and the world was on edge about what is happening to America. Everything Mr Trump said confirmed that those instincts were correct. Presidents have often come into office promising to take the nation on a new path. But if Mr Trump can be believed, his election and his speech signal the biggest shake-up in Washington in living memory. The vital question for the future is whether Mr Trump can be believed. In his speech he mocked those who have been all talk and no action. But there is a risk he could be a victim of that too. He raised the bar for his own presidency to a very high level by insisting that everything would change “right here, right now”. But will it? The power of the presidency has grown over the decades, and the 2016 election has now put the Republicans in charge of all the arms of government. But Mr Trump is not, at least not yet, a dictator. He has to govern with a Congress that does not share all his priorities – in some cases, Mr Trump’s priorities may even be preferable – and according to law that is interpreted by the courts. The states have a lot of power to defy him, as California seems determined to do in the case of the planned wall with Mexico. It has been argued that voters chose Mr Trump knowing that he would challenge the system, but confident that the system would protect the voters from the worst consequences. That may prove right. But Mr Trump should not be underestimated. He is a proud disrupter not a diffident conformist. He is – and intends to be – different from the presidents of the past: in his personality, his working style, his ways of communicating and, most important of all, in his political aims. Those who support him and those who fear him are agreed on that. Yet he has arrived in the White House with low ratings and amid a deep sense of division. His inauguration was boycotted by several leaders and will be protested against by tens of thousands. His attempts to overturn America’s political hierarchy and culture will enthuse some – the stock market is thrumming – but terrify others. The realities of Mr Trump’s disruptive intentions will be revealed in the weeks and months ahead. The first downpayments on his turbulent agenda can be found on the White House website. Domestically, the biggest programme will be the infrastructure projects that formed the only detailed pledge of the inaugural address. Beyond America’s shores, much is still guesswork: the probable clash with China poses the biggest threat of all; whether Mr Trump gets his way on Russia may depend on his more sceptical cabinet. “The time for empty talk is over,” said President Trump today. “Now arrives the hour of action.” At home and abroad, and in the light of today’s speech, that is a truly terrifying prospect.",2017-01-20T18:04:44Z,Opinion
111,trump,"Trump's first speech in office was unapologetic appeal to nationalism Braggart and bigot now in control of the world’s most powerful military and economy. Fear and malevolence won Even the heavens wept. As Donald Trump stepped forward to become America’s 45th president the cold shower that broke over Washington offered no end of metaphors. His address, however, was literal to a fault. There was no higher calling, no sense of a greater purpose, no florid imagery or impassioned idealism. This was as crude and unapologetic an appeal to nationalism as one might expect from a man incapable of rising to an occasion without first refracting it through his ego. It is said that presidents campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Trump campaigned in graffiti – the profane scrawls of a mindless vandal – and, if his inaugural address was anything to go by, may yet govern in tweets – the impulsive, abbreviated interventions of a narcissist. Were this a reality TV show, we would have switched off by now. All the better qualified, more sympathetic and empathic characters have been eliminated. The last man standing is a scheming, pathological misanthrope whose disrespect for the rules alone should have disqualified him. The producer would have been fired; the advertisers would have bolted. Nobody in their right mind would want anything to do with it. But there is a difference between reality TV and something surreal that you can watch on TV. From the robed supreme court chief justice holding aloft Lincoln’s Bible for Trump to swear on to the gathering of former presidents, the entire purpose of an inauguration is to celebrate a mature democracy. As the White House is bequeathed to the popular choice, it’s intended to symbolise continuity and stability – a common destiny in a shared polity. Friday achieved the opposite. To watch Trump take the oath was to bear witness to democracy’s fragility. It marked not simply the transfer of power from one leader to another but the erosion of the very values that give that power legitimacy. That frailty stems not from any question about whether Trump won the election but how he won it and what that victory portends. There is more to democracy than elections and more to elections than simply voting. Democratic traditions are underpinned by norms that he not only disregarded (on that score he would not be the first) but brazenly and gleefully violated – advocating violence at his rallies, haranguing the media, fuelling racial animus, religious exclusion and misogyny. As such, his inauguration represents an indictment of an entire political culture. It leaves condemned a Democratic party that could not defeat him, a Republican party that would not disown him, a mainstream media that failed to scrutinise him and a social media that spread his lies far faster than any scrutiny could travel. All were found wanting. Now all will be tested. This is no local problem. Those who take to the streets across the globe to demonstrate Trump’s presidency over the next few days would do well to stay there and resist his counterparts in their own backyards. Where this particular threat to democracy is concerned, America is by no means exceptional. In Washington, the moment was all the more disorienting because of what it replaced. Barack Obama’s approval ratings are higher now than they have been for some time, reminding us of the stratospheric expectations of that freezing January day when he first took office eight years ago. It’s as though his presence could never compete with his promise or his passing. To watch him accompany Trump through the process was to see the civility of pageantry triumph over the candour of politics. Several of those with front-row seats, from both parties, had concluded Trump was unfit for the office he now holds. “When making life or death or war or peace decisions,” Michelle Obama said six weeks before election day, “a president just can’t pop off or lash out irrationally … If a candidate traffics in fear and lies on the campaign trail … well that is the kind of president they will be.” That is the president who was sworn in on Friday. No amount of pomp and finery can mask that. That is why what was billed as a ceremony felt more akin to a charade. It is also why many in the US, and beyond, are not simply concerned about what comes next; they are genuinely terrified. An impulsive braggart and bigot is now in control of the world’s most powerful military and economy. Fear and malevolence won. The hands that once grabbed pussy now have access to the nuclear launch codes.",2017-01-20T18:02:32Z,News
112,trump,"White House website switches over to Trump's 'America-first' policy agenda The Obama administration’s priorities of civil rights and climate change were replaced with ‘bringing back jobs and growth’ and ‘rebuild American military’ At the moment the presidency was transferred to Donald Trump from Barack Obama, a digital transfer of power also took place online: the White House website was dramatically reorganized on Friday, to emphasize the incoming administration’s priorities.Just a couple of minutes after Trump was sworn in, Obama’s policies were moved to an archival website and promptly replaced with a new slate of priorities, which drastically underscored the differences between the two men’s administrations. Where Obama’s White House website housed information on civil rights, climate change, LGBT rights, healthcare, immigration, education and the “Iran Deal” among others, Trump’s White House website, instead, lists just six “issues”. “America first energy plan” has replaced climate change as a priority, while “Bringing back jobs and growth” focuses on lowering taxes. Civil rights has been replaced with “Standing up with our law enforcement community” and emphasizes the “lawlessness” of illegal immigration and inner cities. The White House website spells out a bit more of what the incoming administration means by an “America first foreign policy”. The phrase used is “peace through strength” which involves a pledge to “rebuild the American military”. The online statement notes that the US navy has shrunk from 500 to 275 ships over the past 15 years and that the air force has been reduced by a third over the same period. It pledges that the new president “is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned”. The statement avoids stating goals however. For example, there is no repeat of the campaign pledge to boost the navy to 350 ships. Defeating the Islamic State and other “radical Islamic terror groups” is named as the first foreign policy priority, which will be achieved through “joint and coalition military operations”, working with international partners to cut off funding, expanded intelligence sharing, and offensive cyberwarfare targeted on terrorist propaganda and recruiting. There is talk of allies being welcome, but nothing specific about upholding existing alliances like Nato. On trade, the issue titled “Trade Deals Working For All Americans”, there is a pledge to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Area is held off for the time being, pending renegotiation. The website statement warns: “If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA.” In another move undertaken immediately after the transfer of power, the men also updated their respective Twitter accounts. Now, the @POTUS handle belongs to Trump (who at the time of this writing, had yet to tweet), and Obama moved his social media and all previous tweets to @POTUS44.",2017-01-20T19:53:00Z,News
113,trump,"China eyes an opportunity to take ownership of climate change fight The economic and environmental cost of pollution will drive Beijing’s policies regardless of what Donald Trump does Twenty years ago, climate change was believed by many in Beijing to be a conspiracy cooked up by the western world to contain China’s development. Since then, China has performed an about-turn, not only recognising climate change as a major global challenge but also, ahead of Davos this week, vowing to lead the world’s effort in combating it. The election of Donald Trump, who, labelling climate change a “hoax” created by China, has reversed the conspiracy, casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation. But for China, now could be a moment of opportunity. Since the catastrophic Copenhagen failure in 2009, China has anchored climate actions at the core of its political agenda. There are three main reasons for this, and over the next four years, they will be the drivers that will propel China’s climate action forward regardless of the political situation in the US. First, the calculus of cost and benefit has shifted. For a long time, environmental protection was positioned on the opposite side of economic prosperity – the pursuit of one could only sacrifice the other. In China, this binary has fallen apart, as the enormous health impacts of air pollution have galvanised both political and public opinion against polluting industry, and as the booming clean energy industry shows the possibility to make both environmentally and economically sound investments. Second, China feels an increased – and increasing – sense of global responsibility, as displayed in phrase after phrase of Xi Jinping’s speeches in Davos and Geneva this week. Beijing was quick to learn from its mistakes in Copenhagen. In the run up to the Paris conference, it managed to forge consensus on the most difficult political questions with other key players ahead of time. Many of these political breakthroughs, such as on common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and the issue of transparency, will require China to move beyond its previous positions and take more ambitious action. In addition, China has started to implement its own south-south cooperation scheme, aimed at helping other developing countries to pursue climate action. China is slowly but surely re-defining its international responsibilities and shifting to a more active and cooperation oriented climate diplomacy. Third, China’s leaders have started to take ownership of combating climate change. This new dynamic could bear promising prospects over the next few years. US-China cooperation on climate in the Obama era helped to elevate climate change to the very top of the Chinese leadership’s agenda. This has ensured the unprecedented direct engagement of the Chinese leaders for multiple years, and not only familiarised them with the technicality and politics of climate change, but also allowed them to see the strategic value it can generate. With Xi soon entering his second five-year tenure, he might well take a leaf out of the outgoing US president’s book and try to secure climate action as one of his political legacies. This could mean further investment in and greater leadership on climate action. These three reasons, coupled with the fundamental trend of China’s economic transition and the associated coal consumption decline, present a real opportunity for China to project further international leadership on climate change. What China urgently needs now is a comprehensive strategy that sets climate change as a diplomatic priority. For the past years, China’s policy circle primarily considered climate change through the lens of managing US-China relations and as an issue subordinate to the most important bilateral relationship in the world. As the political winds shift in Washington, climate change now deserves an independent strategy that takes into account but is not dependent on the US-China relationship. Chinese leaders should be confident in such an approach and not underestimate the country’s potential for global leadership. The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road initiative both demonstrate that, when the issue is given political priority, China is not only able to participate in international diplomacy, but can also actively lead. None of these is to say China should step in for the US. Climate change is a crisis larger than any single country. And it is neither feasible nor fair to expect other countries to fill the hole left by the US. But for China, if what it takes to move from a climate villain to a reluctant leader is the short five years of the first half of this decade, it is not completely unreasonable to expect the country to become a true leader by the end of this decade. As Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Xi might well establish one of his own. Li Shuo is Greenpeace’s east Asia senior climate policy adviser based in Beijing.",2017-01-20T01:57:44Z,News
114,trump,"Protesters barricade Uber offices: 'No business as usual' on inauguration day Activists hold signs attacking company that ‘collaborates with Trump’ as protests are staged at other sites around San Francisco Protesters attempt to disrupt inaugural events in Washington Anti-Trump protesters barricaded the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco on Friday morning to call attention to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s “collaboration” with the new administration on Trump’s inauguration day. Protesters blocked traffic outside the ride-hailing company’s main office with a giant banner reading: “Uber collaborates with Trump”, while others used PVC piping and chains to blockade the entrances to the building. “Travis Kalanick is collaborating with the Trump administration by being part of Trump’s advisory council,” said Sarah Nelson, one of the protesters. Kalanick, along with Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, and other business magnates, joined the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum following the election. “If the Trump regime follows the same policies as Uber, then we’re all in for a very bad four years,” she added. Uber has long faced criticism for classifying its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, a distinction that prevents them from unionizing or receiving benefits such as the minimum wage, overtime, and workers’ compensation. On Thursday, the company agreed to pay $20m to settle a Federal Trade Commission claim that it misled drivers over how much they would earn. “As a company we’re committed to working with government on issues that affect riders, drivers and the cities where we operate,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement responding to the protest. “Just as we worked with the Obama Administration, we’ll work with the Trump Administration, too.” Other protesters said they wanted to draw attention to how the tech industry and sharing economy companies have gentrified San Francisco and exploited workers. “What we are seeing from the Trump administration is that corporate America and the government of the United States of America is becoming one and the same,” said Brihannala Morgan, a 35-year-old environmental campaigner protesting outside the Uber headquarters. “The companies throwing support to Donald Trump are showing they don’t share the values of San Francisco or the United States.” Morgan said it appeared that 16 people were arrested, though she was not taken into custody. She noted that she was recently priced out of San Francisco and noted that Uber has helped contribute to rising rents and displacement. “Having organizations like Uber come in buying huge office spaces in low-income communities is hiking up rent prices and is just fundamentally opposed to the values we have in the Bay Area,” she said, adding, “Uber is replacing strong union jobs that are poor paying and make below minimum wage and don’t provide security.” Dana Perls, a 36-year-old nonprofit worker, said, “Uber is supporting Trump and Uber is destroying the fabric of the Bay Area … Uber has done the opposite of investing in the community.” She noted that Uber drivers don’t earn enough to sustain a family. “We want business in California and across the country to support people and not to support a fascist leader like Trump.” The Uber protest was one of several around San Francisco on Friday morning. Protesters also blocked the Wells Fargo headquarters, a financial district building partially owned by Trump, and the tracks of Caltrain, a commuter railway that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley. The San Francisco police department did not have details on arrests or charges against any of the protesters, but said a “mass arrest” had occurred at the Uber protest. Officers remained stationed outside the office after the arrests. Protesters plastered signs on a nearby building that read: “Uber collaborates. We resist.” “I apologize to the Uber employees that attempted to get into the building today,” said Nelson. “We understand that people are trying to work, but today there is no business as usual.”",2017-01-20T18:14:31Z,News
115,trump,"Obama departs White House with a promise: 'I'll be right there with you' After eight years as America’s first black president, Obama handed over the White House to Trump – but not before tweeting last thoughtsThanks, Obama: how the president’s supporters spent his last day in office With barely a flicker to betray the emotions of the day, Barack and Michelle Obama stepped out of the White House at 10.50am on Friday for the last time as president and first lady of the United States. After eight historic years as America’s first black president, Obama departed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and prepared to hand over the keys not to America’s first female president in Hillary Clinton, as he hoped and expected, but to Donald Trump. The Obamas and the Trumps, Donald and Melania, had just spent 45 minutes inside over tea and coffee, a tradition. The public greetings were measured and diplomatically warm – Melania Trump handing over a blue Tiffany gift box under the North Portico. The Obamas seemed like stiffer, more formal versions of their true selves. Within the hour they were off, travelling together to Capitol Hill – the women in one limousine and the men in the car behind. Perhaps conscious that once the Trumps arrived everything would become something of a blur, Obama had used his presidential Twitter account, @POTUS (President of the United States) to communicate some thoughts. “It’s been the honor of my life to serve you,” he wrote just after 9am. “You made me a better leader and a better man.” Then: “I won’t stop; I’ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor and love.” And: “I’m still asking you to believe – not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours. I believe in change because I believe in you.” At 9.14am, Obama was filmed through the glass door of the Oval Office as he completed his final act there, leaving a letter of welcome to his successor, as tradition allows. He shared the space with a man halfway up a step ladder, who appeared to be removing the last traces of the 44th president in time for the imminent arrival of the 45th. Asked if he felt nostalgic, Obama replied: “Of course.” With those two words and his last presidential words immortalised on the web, he was out. Arriving at the Capitol to witness the official passing of power on a mild, cloudy day with dampness in the air, he and Michelle took their places on the West Front of the Capitol. Earlier in the morning, a US Marine Corps helicopter had been spotted on the east side, waiting to take the Obamas away. Obama sat next to the outgoing vice-president, Joe Biden. Michelle Obama sat behind him. Behind her were the Clintons. As President Trump delivered an astonishing, dark, almost dystopian inaugural speech, staggeringly more raw than the norm, Obama attempted to maintain an inscrutable expression. But he appeared grim. However, after Trump wound up his speech and pumped his fists in the air like a prizefighter, Obama shook his hand and clapped him on the arm and could be seen mouthing “good job”. The Obamas followed the Trumps up the carpeted stairs back into the Capitol, each stopping at the top to greet Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican candidate for president, and his wife Elizabeth. Once inside, Obama and Trump strode across the Rotunda together, their wives behind with Vice-President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, and leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were among the politicians gathered, alongside military guardsmen on the steps of the East Front of the Capitol as the Obamas and Trumps emerged back into the outdoors. Known as Marine One when a sitting president is aboard, for the immediate-ex president Obama and first lady the waiting helicopter would be known as Executive One. Obama descended the steps shoulder to shoulder with Trump, chatting and sharing a joke. At the bottom, Obama smiled broadly. His wife could not hide an expression akin to melancholy. He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it, giving her a reassuring smile. Then the Trumps walked the Obamas the few short steps across the rain-soaked paving to the helicopter. Moments after, Biden and his wife Jill got into a limousine to take them to Union station so they could return to Delaware. Barack Obama kissed Melania Trump on the cheek and Donald Trump kissed Michelle Obama, and murmured something in her ear. Then Michelle climbed into the helicopter with Barack Obama behind her. He stopped briefly at the top of the steps to wave twice, smiling, then ducked inside and the door was shut. The Trumps retreated halfway up the steps of the Capitol to stand with the Pences as the helicopter, seconds after 12.45pm, lifted into grey skies and flew towards Joint Base Andrews, where the former president and first lady would be reunited with their daughters, Malia and Sasha. At Andrews, Obama gave a short speech to staff that was in complete contrast to Trump’s gloomy inaugural address. While Trump spoke of inner-city “carnage”, of closed factories and crumbling infrastructure, Obama returned to his abiding theme of hope. “You decided to believe and you knocked on doors and made phone calls,” he said. “You didn’t know how to pronounce Barack Obama, but we got to know each other and throughout it was infused with hope.” As staff members became tearful, he added that he and Michelle had simply been “the front men”. “It’s always been about you,” he said. “All the amazing things that have happened over these last 10 years are really just a testament to you.” The Obamas spent a good 35 minutes saying and hugging their goodbyes. Then they strode across the rain-soaked apron and held hands to walk along a red carpet leading to the steps up into the presidential 747. Familiar the world over as Air Force One, the jet is only called that when a sitting president is aboard. With the Obamas aboard it was simply the presidential plane. They paused to wave and then disappeared inside. The now-former first family have planned a sunshine holiday in Palm Springs, California. No doubt, the golf course will feature. The presidential plane set its nose to the west, with a chance for the Obamas to sit back and relax. No more pre-dawn briefings to come. In a farewell interview on CBS, Obama had said: “Well, here’s one thing is, I’m not setting my alarm. That, I’m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I’m going to spend time with Michelle. “And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We’ve both been busy.”",2017-01-20T17:28:19Z,News
116,trump,"Trump's here. We have four years to write a better story It’s time to stop playing nice with those who want to destroy us. To win, politicians must offer more radical dreams Trump is now our president, and no savior will stand between America and its mess. Best case scenario, the most powerful man in the world is a New York Berlusconi. At worst? Picture an elderly, vindictive trust fund brat, surrounded by kleptocrats, racists and pucker-faced spawnlings, his toy box stuffed with spy tools and death machines, the likes of which prior despots could never have imagined. It takes both skill and luck to bake a FailCake as bad as this, and you’ve got to do the prep work for years. Start with a racist celebrity liar. Soak him in media attention. Plunk him into the electoral college, a system engineered to empower slave states at the expense of densely populated cities, then subtract section four of the Voting Rights Act and add in a dash of discriminatory voter ID laws in crucial states. Next, bake upon the ashes of neoliberalism. Shred in Hillary Clinton, victim of misogyny and her husband’s scandals, who also represents everything cowardly, venal and bland about the old order. Smother the whole mess in resentment – some economic woe, some racism, some hatred of women, some deserved loathing for our political class. Sprinkle with “oh fuck it”. Remove on 8 November. Serve lukewarm. In 2016’s hall of corpses, the most loudly mourned might be that of the Liberal Political Consensus. The system served some well, and many more horribly, but it’s murdered, dead, done. In the new world, Hillary Clinton, the realistic, electable candidate, is neither, and institutions meant to keep populists out of power collapse like old soufflés. Like millions of others, reasonable media centrists were blindsided; no wonder they now sound like they’re hitting hallucinogenics. When they’re not playing dress-up as “the resistance”, or blaming Russian-hacked gossip for Clinton’s thin electoral losses, they’re staging grand, last-ditch supplications to electors, the intelligence community, Congress … anyone who might save American democracy from the consequences of its choice. What they don’t realize is there is no going back. Donald Trump may have lost by nearly 3m votes, but this election is a verdict on the status quo. To win, politicians must offer more radical dreams. These can be Trumpian con-jobs, or the humane democratic socialism of Bernie Sanders. In four years, if the Democrats become an actual party for the working class, one that campaigns in all 50 states, fights voter suppression, doesn’t court a mythical White Working Class by kicking the brown, black and queer people who still have its back, if it runs candidates who talk in real words, not Goldman Sachs platitudes, and if it fights Trump till the bloody dawn … maybe it has a shot. To do this, Democrats must learn from their prior sins. The party will be fighting a president they themselves empowered. The Democratic Clinton built mass incarceration, and the Democratic Obama administration championed assassination by drone. The deportations, the torture, the surveillance, the crony capitalism are all part of a system created by Democrats as much as Republicans, all reinforced by adult, bipartisan voices in respectable, badly cut suits. Trump’s promise? Things will get harrowingly, epically worse. Instead of merely rendering Muslims to secret prisons, he’ll do something “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding” to them beneath a gold Trump marquee. You thought mass surveillance was bad? Wait until he dips into the NSA server farms, then tweets out his critics’ sex tapes. Or cheers on hate crimes before rallies of capped fanboys. Or classes protesters as terrorists. He’ll be yuge. But the man couldn’t do it without the infrastructure bequeathed to him by past administrations. Trump is not a builder. Not of skyscrapers, and not of gulags. He just makes money licensing his name. If you want real resistance, look to the people who fought, and are still fighting, this infrastructure. Indigenous activists. Radical lawyers. Prison solidarity networks. Abortion funds. Churches converted into sanctuary spaces. Anarchists who hold noise demonstrations outside of jails in the freezing January night, so humans inside know they are not forgotten. These groups are even more vital because Trump is not alone. His presidency is the showiest example of a global love affair with fascism; soft rich boy he may be, but he’s a bloated pea in the Duterte, Erdoğan, Putin, Modi pod. In a chaotic world, many people want two things – identity and Daddy. They long for a leader who promises not just to keep them safe, fed and emotionally validated, but to accomplish these things by punishing an imagined Other – the impure, foreign, unreal source of all the homeland’s humiliations. Depending on the country, this Other may be black, Kurdish, Mexican, gay; dancing at a nightclub, doing drugs or wearing a hijab. She may be an impoverished refugee or a decadent urbanite, but she is always looking down her nose at the decent, demagogue-supporting majority. She’s always laughing. Of course, that silent majority doesn’t exist, and neither does that Other. They’re stock figures in an authoritarian’s playbook, substitutes for solutions in our complex, impure, interwoven world. Economic justice is just the first step to beating fascists, orange-colored or otherwise. We need to fight for each other, every last one of us. Not to “tolerate”, like one tolerates painful shoes, but to proudly say that this world belongs to all of us, and that we’re not going anywhere. Ethno-nationalists are escaping from neoliberalism’s cracks, just as they crawled forth from the rot of 19th century empires, singing the same false and bloody tune. On the page, and in the streets, we must write a better story. We have four years.",2017-01-20T10:30:05Z,Opinion
117,trump,"Inauguration protests: more than 200 demonstrators arrested in Washington Thousands took to the streets of Washington DC for peaceful protests, but pockets of violence saw clashes between police and the president’s dissenters Donald Trump sworn in as 45th president of the United States Inauguration schedule of events: a guide to Trump’s first day More than 200 protesters were arrested on Friday as police used pepper spray and stun grenades to suppress a series of small, violent confrontations before and after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Thousands of protesters from numerous groups descended on Washington DC for mostly peaceful protest throughout inauguration day, in a sign of the dissent and discord Trump’s divisive presidential campaign produced. Shortly after Trump was sworn in, violent protests broke out in the downtown area close to the north lawn of the White House and just blocks from the pathway of the inaugural parade. A few dozen protesters, clad in black, threw projectiles at police and barricaded the road with newspaper kiosks and bins, which they later set fire to. The group were quickly surrounded by police in riot gear who used sting-ball grenades and pepper spray, police said, after a black limousine was set on fire. Before the swearing-in ceremony took place activists from the anarchist group known as the black bloc smashed storefront windows and cars as they clashed with police. Officers in riot gear had again responded with pepper spray and sting-ball grenades, according to police, as the breakaway protesters were overwhelmed with force less than two miles from the US Capitol. The group of about 200 people, many wearing black hoodies and masks, were eventually contained in a police cordon as they chanted: “This is what a police state looks like” and “You’re protecting fascists”. But live-streaming from inside the cordon, known as a police “kettle” revealed that journalists and legal observers were also being held inside. By Friday evening, some members of this first group, had filed a class action lawsuit against the DC metropolitan police department, claiming that they had “suffered physical and emotional injury, as well as loss of liberty” during the episode. Most of the masked protesters declined to be interviewed or named, but one man who refused to give his name said their purpose was to reject “a system of economic exploitation called capitalism”. “It’s not just about no order,” he said. “It’s about human freedom and an economy that’s run by the people.” A spokesman for the DC metropolitan police said law enforcement had arrested 217 people by Friday evening while six officers suffered minor injuries including three officers suffering head traumas after being struck by projectiles. The spokesman also denied that officers had deployed teargas on protesters, despite media reports suggesting otherwise. “We expected this kind of thing from this kind of group, and they’re going to be held accountable,” said Peter Newsham, the interim chief of police, on MSNBC. At a press conference on Friday evening DC mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged the “hundreds and hundreds” of protesters who had “made their voices heard through nonviolent acts of protest”. But added: “Unfortunately a small group of people have engaged in vandalism as well as violence against our law enforcement officers. “This type of destruction and this type of violence against people in Washington DC will not be tolerated.” Another group of activists had attempted earlier to shut down a number of the security points allowing access to the public viewing area of the inauguration on the National Mall on Friday morning. The small groups at these checkpoints, organised by a group named Disrupt J20, linked arms as some members were led away by police wearing body armor. The organization claimed on social media that they had temporarily shut down a number of the dozen checkpoints around the Mall, with a group of Black Lives Matter protesters reportedly closing access at one location for over an hour. Many protesters gained access to the public viewing areas on the Mall, many chanting “not my president” and holding signs with slogans including “Can we impeach him today?” and “Fascist”. Some protesters were also present along the route of the parade later in the day. As the chief justice, John Roberts, rose to administer the oath of office for the incoming president, six protesters, seated on the lawn just in front of the steps to the Capitol, tore off their coats, jumped on to their chairs and began chanting. “A nation united can never be divided,” they said. Together the letters on their shirts spelled: “Resist!” Around them, supporters shouted and called for them to leave. A man shook their chairs until one of the protesters fell. Eventually, security arrived and they were removed from the event. James Ebersole, a protester who had come to Washington from Virginia, said he had decided to come to DC in order to “voice dissent, to say that this is not OK”. “I think it’s unifying people,” he said of the resistance to Trump’s election, while brandishing a sign that read “Misogyny is a danger to society”. “It’s a call to action, a wake-up call, and it unites us against this threat.” Barbara McQueeney had never attended an inauguration before, but she felt compelled to fly out from St Augustine, Florida, to protest outside the barricades lining the National Mall. “I live in an area where there’s a lot of Trump supporters and I’m crushed,” she said. “We need hope.” McQueeney, who is retired, did not engage in much shouting. She instead stood quietly at the center of a protest lifting a homemade poster with the letters USSR spelling out “United States Satellite of Russia”. “Everyone knows they were involved,” she said of Vladimir Putin’s government, “but everyone is just going forward like it’s business as usual.” As the sun began to set and the parade continued into the evening, some activists capped nearly 12 hours on the streets. Ramah Kudaimi, who organized one of the activities associated with Disrupt J20 collective, accused the president of campaigning “on a platform of racism, bigotry and hate”. “We are taking a stand to say that we are against this. Our actions today made that very clear,” said Kudaimi, a board member of the Washington Peace Center, a grassroots organization centered on social justice. Kudaimi oversaw a demonstration that brought together about 100 people to represent those she said had been harassed and threatened by Trump and his supporters – namely Muslims, immigrants and Jewish communities. They were one of the groups who attempted to shut down an entrance checkpoint earlier in the day. In San Francisco protesters took over the pedestrian pathways of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge in an effort to form a “human chain” on Friday afternoon. The action, which did not blocked vehicle traffic, attracted thousands of people, who held hands as part of a peaceful demonstration. At the San Francisco headquarters of Uber, activists shut down the office building, leading to roughly 16 arrests. The tech company’s CEO recently joined Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Demonstrators also assembled outside Trump Tower in New York City where seven people, including two New York City councilmen were arrested. The crowd assembled late Friday morning and sat in the road, attempting to stop traffic. Hundreds of protesters also marched later in the evening, arriving at Trump’s 40 Wall Street property in the heart of the city’s financial district. Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Washington for a Women’s March that is scheduled for Saturday, with similar events organized in cities around the country.",2017-01-20T22:51:35Z,News
118,trump,"Nigel Farage to become commentator on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Former Ukip leader’s love affair with Donald Trump’s America grows as he lands political analyst role on US news channel Nigel Farage’s love affair with Donald Trump’s America has taken another leap forward with news the former Ukip leader is to become a commentator on Fox News. Fox announced Farage would be joining to provide political analysis on its main news channel and its business network in a short statement during Trump’s swearing-in as the 45th US president. Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has attempted to forge ties with Trump following his victory, and was also a backer of the campaign to leave the EU. New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman has reported that the media mogul, who owns the Sun and Times newspapers in London, speaks to Trump at least three times a week. Trump has publicly praised Farage, posing with him just after his election victory and tweeting that he would make a “great” ambassador to the US. On Thursday night, Farage and his ally Aaron Banks, who bankrolled the Leave.EU campaign, held a party at a Washington hotel near the White House. During the event, Farage repeatedly praised Trump, describing him as “the only person I have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert” and saying that “Brexit is great, but Trump is Brexit plus plus plus”. Steve Hilton, the former adviser to David Cameron who was also recently unveiled as a Fox contributor, was also at the party organised by Banks and Farage. Trump did not attend despite the organisers repeatedly suggesting he might. It is unclear whether the Fox role will affect Farage’s radio show on LBC, which only began two weeks ago, or his role as MEP for south-east England.",2017-01-20T17:12:20Z,News
119,trump,"Women's March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters With Donald Trump newly installed in the Oval Office, co-chairs herald ‘one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen’ At about 10am on Saturday, as a quarter of a million or more people gather in protest at the base of Capitol Hill for the Women’s March on Washington, the newly minted President Donald Trump will be on his knees at “a service of prayer and reflection” at the National Cathedral. From that perch four miles away from the White House he won’t, initially, be able to hear the civil rights legend Angela Davis, the feminist icon Gloria Steinem or the pro-choice campaigner Cecile Richards addressing the crowds at the march. But the roar of the masses will surely reach the president’s ears later, as the speeches and A-list performers wrap up the three-to-four hour rally and the demonstrators march to the Ellipse, the large green space opposite the White House. He may even see them if he steps out on to the balcony in the residence to admire the view of the Washington Monument. “I hope he will be praying about how to be the president of all the people. We are not going to let our rights be rolled back by anyone,” Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and a speaker at the march, said. The march organizers are still officially only expecting a crowd of 200,000 to 250,000 people – mostly women, but also many men – based on the number who have registered. But those close to the planning acknowledge that they are prepared, in coordination with the police, city officials and thousands of volunteers and private security staff, if the numbers swell considerably, to half a million or beyond. The event is expected to turn into one of the largest marches in US history and although it is not billed specifically as an anti-Trump protest, most of the causes represented are those deemed under threat from the new administration. “I’m speaking out and marching because healthcare is under attack and women’s reproductive rights are under attack. So many awful things were said about women by the incoming president,” said Campbell. “I put a lot of my energy under Obama into supporting black women’s leadership and women’s leadership overall – we could have broken the glass ceiling with Hillary Clinton and it didn’t happen, so that’s what’s motivated me to take part,” she added. Campbell took exception to Trump’s gloomy inaugural speech and his portraiture of inner cities as being in a state of a crime-ridden “American carnage”. “That’s not the urban America I know. Not that there are not problems, but it’s not all rocked with violence and poverty. America is already great, it’s a melting pot and must continue to be,” she said. On Saturday morning, Campbell and other speakers’ voices will boom out from jumbotrons positioned among the thousands packing along Independence Avenue, calling for action on racial equality, climate change, criminal justice reform, a higher minimum wage, immigrants’ rights and a host of other progressive issues. Among those on stage or seated next to the stage in VIP seating will be some of the 60-plus members of Congress from the Democratic party who were set to boycott Trump’s inauguration ceremony on Friday. One of those is US representative Chellie Pingree. While Trump was being sworn in on Friday, she was visiting a Planned Parenthood center and a business owned by immigrants in her home state of Maine, before flying to Washington in the afternoon to get ready for the march. On Saturday morning, she will gather with fellow politicians on stage at the rally and then march with some of the 5,000 women attending from the state of Maine. “We need to do everything we can to let the incoming administration know we are not happy about their agenda. I’ve had unprecedented numbers of my constituents calling me worried about healthcare, the environment, public education, and they feel disrespected,” she said. Pingree said Trump was the most unpredictable incoming president most people had ever witnessed. While Trump struggled to get A-list names to perform at his inauguration celebrations, the Women’s March on Washington has attracted singing and acting stars such as Katy Perry; America Ferrera, who is also speaking at the rally; the Orange is the New Black cast member Uzo Aduba; the actor Scarlett Johansson; Cher and the young actor and singer Zendaya. The march grew organically, from a feminist outcry on Facebook in the immediate aftershock of the election result. Organizers now hope it will kickstart a new era of grassroots activism across a long list of progressive issues chiefly related to equality and social and economic justice. What began as an expression of frustration and a call to action on social media then morphed into a mass mobilization across multiple progressive causes. The event began to be physically realized on Friday as buses, trains and planes started pouring into Washington, packed full of women – and supportive male friends dotted among them. Although so-called sister marches are taking place in as many as 300 cities across all 50 states, as well as internationally, thousands chose the capital city to make their presence felt next to the Capitol and the White House. “This is what a plane full of women who are ready to resist the Trump agenda looks like,” read one tweet, showing a flight bound for DC packed with women smiling and waving ecstatically, some wearing pink knit “pussy hats” that have become an informal uniform for the march. “I am a woman of color and a Muslim from an immigrant family whose country is now going to be led by someone who has been openly anti-immigrant and sexist, has attacked Muslims and is surrounding himself with some horrible people for his cabinet,” said Zahra Billoo, director of the San Francisco chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a speaker at the march. “I don’t think that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is racist, but they were willing to overlook that part of his campaign for whatever reason, and that’s not acceptable. We’ve seen the fallout, in hate crimes, and there is a need for inspiration and community across racial lines, religious lines, family lines, across many communities in America right now,” she said. Billoo said she found Trump’s inaugural speech “no better than so many of his campaign speeches”. She saw in it coded language designed to further divide rather than unite voters and to erase civil liberties, she said. “All of this ‘America first’ is one way of saying if you don’t agree with us, we will come after you,” she said. Following scuffles and arrests in protests coinciding with the inauguration on Friday, Billoo said she hoped the Women’s March on Washington itself would be a wholly peaceful rally and demonstration. The march is due to finish at dusk. But Linda Sarsour, one of the four march co-chairs, hopes that the end of the event will mark the beginning of a new movement. “Making the march happen has been one of the largest grassroots efforts that anyone has ever seen. This is a mass mobilization and we intend to hold the administration to account,” she said.",2017-01-20T21:00:17Z,News
120,trump,"New president's fans gather on National Mall for 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' Red hats abound in Washington ahead of president-elect’s swearing-in, but some supporters voice doubts: ‘I’ll hold him to account’ A steady flow of red trucker hats snaked to checkpoints around the US Capitol and the National Mall on Friday morning to mark the transfer of power from Barack Obama to Donald Trump. “I never thought I’d be here in the first place, but to be here for the election of Donald Trump, it’s incredible,” Ann Marie Sinisi, who came to Washington DC with her family for the inauguration from Queens, New York, the borough where the president-elect was born. Sinisi has been familiar with Trump since he was a young businessman bragging about his prowess to local tabloids. She is doubtful the presidency will change Trump, and that’s exactly why she voted for him. “He is who he is,” she said, adding: “A lot of people think he’s a bad businessman because of all the bankruptcies. That’s not always a bad thing – I’m a bankruptcy lawyer!” Her daughter, Dawn Marie Sinisi Feiler, said Trump’s biggest task ahead would be uniting the country, which has been rocked by protests since his election. “I really believe he’s already made changes – like the factory jobs,” Sinisi Feiler said, referring to public pressure Trump had put on companies to keep American jobs in the country, with debatable effectiveness. “If he keeps doing that, if he does so much good that it’s undeniable, he will unite the country.” Isaac Deal travelled by bus to the inauguration from Indianapolis with his classmates. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Deal said, wearing a camouflage Make America Great Again hat. At 19, his first vote cast for president was for Trump. Deal said he liked Trump’s anti-establishment message, his railing against money in politics and crony capitalism, but he said he had been dismayed by Trump’s cabinet picks, which include a number of billionaires with Wall Street ties. “Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp and with his cabinet picks he’s picking the very same trolls who run the swamp,” he said, adding that he was willing to give Trump more time to build his team. “I voted for him because I thought he was the best man for the job, but I’m not a Trump fanboy. I’ll hold him to account,” Deal said. Anthony Juiffrey, of New York, said he had voted for Trump because of his economic agenda and promise to create more jobs in America. He said he understands the protesters – and might have been one himself had Trump lost - but said the charges against Trump’s supporters were not fair. “I’ve heard all the ‘ists’ – racist, chauvinist, you name it,” Juiffrey said. “That’s not true … If Trump came out with some kind of serious plan, government-sponsored racism, where he said let’s throw out all the Mexicans or something like that, I’d be really upset and I’d fight that. But so far that’s not what he’s saying.” Ronald Celony, a Trump voter, had flown in from Miami, Florida, to take in the day’s festivities. “I cannot see it on TV – I have to see it live,” he said, before gesturing to his surroundings. Celony, who immigrated from Haiti more than two decades ago, said he was confident Trump would “bring jobs back to America”. “People can say whatever they want about Trump, but he knows exactly what he’s doing,” he said. “When you see what he’s accomplished in his life, if he puts the same ideas in office, he’s going to make America great again. There’s no doubt about it.” Stella Slattery, a resident of upstate New York, dubbed it “a historic day” as she made her way toward the Capitol in a white Trump-Pence T-shirt. She, too, pointed to Trump’s vast business empire as evidence of his promise. “Donald Trump is a proven businessman,” Slattery said, “and it’s about time that America be run like a corporation and not like a free-for-all for a few politicians and well-to-do.” Asked about her hopes for Trump’s presidency, she offered a simple thought: “To bring America to what it used to be.” Many of those who descended upon Washington to support the president-elect expressed similar sentiments, echoing Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail. He would be a champion of the working class, they insisted, and perhaps most importantly would serve as a symbol against the politics that have long ruled the nation’s capital. “Both the Republican and Democratic establishment has let America down,” said John D, a Trump supporter who requested not to provide his full name. “Even though Donald Trump isn’t a politician and we don’t know what we’re going to get out of him, at least it’s going to be different,” he said. Hailing from Michigan, one of the battleground states where Trump’s victory was most unexpected, John D said he expected better trade policies from Trump and a closure of US borders. But he acknowledged there was a level of risk associated with the incoming president. “It may be good or it may be bad, but it’s a change worth taking.” There were some hangovers from the anger-fuelled campaign that lifted Trump to victory in November. A man in a cowboy hat posed for a photo with a shirt that said “Hillary for Prison 2016”. Asked whether he was disappointed Trump backed off his pledge to jail his political opponent if elected, the man waved away the question. “Today’s a good day,” he said, walking away without giving his name. “I’m thrilled to be here.”",2017-01-20T15:05:35Z,News
121,trump,"Welcome to a new era of  politically sanctioned patriarchy The parallels between misogyny in the US and Egypt are stark – we must respond by recognising the common enemy Today, I will force myself to watch the inauguration of Donald Trump because I want to stay angry. The sight of a sexual predator taking the oath to become the president of the most powerful country on earth will keep my pilot light of rage burning bright. I take pride in that anger. As I do my declaration of faith: “Fuck the Patriarchy”. As an Egyptian-American feminist, my cup of patriarchy overfloweth. The first foreign leader to call and congratulate Trump upon his election victory in November was the Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Of course! I could not imagine two world leaders whose public record of misogyny better capture the politically sanctioned patriarchy that so challenges feminism today. One, Trump, has openly boasted that his fame allowed him to “grab women by the pussy”. At least 24 women have accused the next US president of inappropriate sexual behaviour in multiple incidents spanning the last 30 years. The other, Sisi, was the head of military intelligence in March 2011 when 17 female activists detained at protests were subjected to “virginity tests” by the military. The women were vaginally examined against their will by military doctors. Sisi justified the tests at the time, saying they were to protect the military against accusations of rape – as if only virgins could technically be raped. When the leader of a country is so misogynist, so abusive and cavalier with regards to women’s bodies, it sends a green light that women’s bodies are fair game, not worthy of respect. Some, especially on the right wing in the US, like to tell American women to consider the sorry plight of women in Egypt, for example. Look how bad it is over there, they say, in order to make women grateful that they live in the US. Such myopic misogyny, in essence, is telling women to shut up, accept their lot and be grateful they have it so good. Some, especially among those who deny misogyny in Egypt, like to tell Egyptian women to consider the reality of women’s lives in the US, for example. They still have not elected a woman as president, they say, to make them realise that the US isn’t that much better than Egypt. Such denial of misogyny in essence is telling women to shut up and accept their lot because it’s shit everywhere. Then Trump happened. And before him, Sisi happened. And as 2014 election results from Egypt and 2016 results from the US reminded us, they happened with the help of a lot of women who voted for those two Misogynists in Chief. Gratitude and acceptance be damned! When I heard that 53% of white American women voters cast their ballot for Trump I was enraged. But the Egyptian and Muslim in me also had a moment not so much of schadenfreude – Trump will hurt us all, not just white women who voted against their own interests – as much as a burning sense of hypocrisy. As that Egyptian, Muslim woman I have been on the receiving end of countless questions about why Muslim women accept x or y and z. Now the same questions can be asked of those voters. Belonging to a faith is slightly different than voting in an election. But you can make an argument that a vote in a free and fair election such as that for US president is equally a clear, if not more direct, expression of one’s principles. I’ve become obsessed with those white women voters who showed up at Trump rallies with “Talk Dirty to Me”, “Adorable Deplorables” and “Grab This Pussy” T-shirts; the women who said that if men don’t use Trump’s awful language about women’s bodies there was something wrong with them; the women who dismissed as liars all the women who accused Trump of assaulting them. Those white women Trump voters allowed their race to trump their gender. They were a reminder that decades of Republican racist policies mixed with increasing Christian fundamentalism and bigotry had succeeded in turning women against their own interests. Those women think they will be protected from Republican patriarchy by allying themselves with it but nothing protects women from patriarchy. In Egypt, I have been obsessed with the women who voted for Sisi: the women who danced at polling stations; who gushed over Sisi as if he were a sensitive beloved whereas he was head of military intelligence during the 25 January 2011 revolution responsible for untold violence. Much like the adoring women at Trump campaign rallies, adulating women at a Sisi conference shortly before his electoral victory in 2014 flocked around him as if he were a teen pop star. Those women voted for Sisi and intentionally forgot that he justified sexual assaults in the form of “virginity tests” because they accepted Sisi’s narrative that he had “saved” them and Egypt from the Muslim Brotherhood. But Sisi just ensured the survival of military rule. Nothing protects women from the patriarchy of military regimes. The roles of Egyptian women in the military are limited to being nurses and administrators. Sisi often talks about women as mothers and wives. He is a conservative, devout man who has overseen a moral crusade against LGBTQ Egyptians. He is no feminist. The religious fundamentalists of the Republican party are a mirror image of the religious fundamentalists of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood. I like to call the Republicans the Christian Brotherhood of the US so that my fellow Americans recognise the line that connects their mix of religion and politics with their Muslim equivalent in Egypt. Both the Christian Brotherhood of the US and Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood are obsessed with women’s bodies – specifically our vaginas. As I like to tell them both: stay out of my vagina unless I want you in there. Examine the record of Trump’s vice president Mike Pence – a Christian fundamentalist who governed Indiana with a mix of misogyny and homophobia while engaged in war with women’s reproductive rights. Another horrifying parallel between Trump and Sisi is their authoritarianism. Trump has appointed the highest number of generals of any US president. Authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism and militarism are inherently patriarchal and hierarchical. You can guess where in that hierarchy women stand. Challenging this hierarchy is 2017’s crusade. The war will be waged most effectively by recognising the global sisterhood of the oppressed and knowing that our battles are local. That is how we will defeat this era of politically sanctioned patriarchy. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter.

122,trump,"Fact-checking the inaugural speech: the economy, crime and hiring American In his first presidential speech, Donald Trump painted a bleak picture on issues ranging from education to the military. Alan Yuhas sorts fact from fiction‘American carnage’: Trump’s vision casts shadow over day of pageantryThe full text of Donald Trump’s inauguration speech “For too long a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government … Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth.” This is technically true – the Washington DC area has seen more than a decade of growth – but more complicated as a rhetorical attack on Washington as a symbol of “the establishment”. The chasm of American inequality has a long history with origins spread around the country. Since 2000, the wealthiest 10% Americans have “reaped” the vast majority of the economy’s rewards. Many of those richest Americans are concentrated on the coasts, but most Americans, regardless of their geography or politics, only saw their income increase in 2015, after years of stagnation. That said, the middle class has been diminishing for years, according to a 2015 Pew study, as the population has shifted more into two other categories: upper income and lower. The actual geography is uneven: some research shows that the most unequal states in 2010 were California and New York, and that states like North Dakota and Montana saw booms and busts alongside the gas industry. Trump has a more literal point, too – the average member of Congress is far wealthier than the average American – but the leaders of Washington DC are hardly uniform in their attitude toward inequality. For instance, Trump’s cabinet (if his nominees are all confirmed) is set to be the wealthiest in history and will include a former banker who profited immensely on foreclosing homes during the 2008 financial crisis, a billionaire called a “vulture” investor because of his history of picking apart businesses, and two other advisers, Steven Bannon and Gary Cohn, who are former Goldman Sachs executives. “Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.” American manufacturing has been in decline for decades for a host of reasons. During the campaign, Trump liked to blame free trade deals such as Nafta, but outsourced jobs are only part of the equation. In 2015, the Congressional Research Service wrote: “Nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.” The deal’s net effect “appears to have been relatively modest”, the researchers concluded. Three years earlier, the OECD found that manufacturing jobs fled the US after the deal was signed but also noted the broader shift toward a service economy. Meanwhile, China has become the world’s largest manufacturer by dint of its beneficial trade status, its human and material resources, its lax and dangerous labor laws, and the steroidal advance of automation, which continues to destroy and create jobs in the US as well. Politicians played a part in all of this, but over multiple generations. “An education system flushed with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.” The US education system, like its economy, is riven by gigantic inequities that vary by state. In 2015-16, public school teachers around the US earned, on average, between $42,025 and $77,957, according to the National Education Association, which would make them squarely in the middle class or on its edges, depending on where they live. Teachers are paid best in New York, Washington DC and Massachusetts, and paid least in South Dakota, Mississippi and Idaho. School districts, on the other hand, differ greatly from each other, and experts have spent decades debating the best ways to shape education. Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has no experience in the public school system and instead has, in her home state of Michigan, campaigned to move students into private charter schools and into voucher programs. Charter schools have spread across Michigan, but the state’s academic performance has slid behind that of other states, and charter schools she has championed are now much derided. “The crime and the gangs and the drugs.” Trump is conjuring up a vision of America as a wasteland that does not square with reality. The nationwide crime rate remains low, about half what it was in 1991, despite a 4% increase in violent crime in 2015. That single-year increase was largely due to major increases in a few cities – namely Baltimore, Washington DC and Chicago – even as the US’s largest cities, including New York and Los Angeles, held crime to historic lows. Murders of black men and murders by firearms accounted for most of the increase. During his campaign, Trump often falsely lumped “gangs” in with undocumented migrants; there is no evidence to suggest that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens, and undocumented migration has not increased for about five years. Trump is correct that the US has a drug problem: a surgeon general’s report last year found that one in seven people in the US will probably develop a substance-abuse problem, and only one in 10 will receive treatment. Trump has talked about wanting to treat addiction as a health problem, but his pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has a record of supporting criminalization in line with the “war on drugs”. “For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own.” Trump is right that corporations, foreign and domestic, have profited enormously in the last decade. He is less correct about national security. The US has budgeted $4.5bn for border security in 2017, an increase from 2016 and in line with Barack Obama’s general expansion of the Border Patrol and homeland security spending. After the so-called sequestration cuts of 2013, a result of a fight between the White House and Congress over taxes, the Pentagon was forced to reduce its budget by 7.7%. The defense department’s leaders have rejected the idea that the military is “depleted”, however, and the Obama administration has worked to replace ageing equipment and develop new weapons. “And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.” A 2013 study estimated that the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost Americans between $4tn and $6tn. Foreign aid, on the other hand, costs on average about $31-$40bn a year, or about 1% of the total US federal budget of $3.5tn. The proposed 2017 budget for foreign aid is $50.1bn. “We will follow two simple rules – buy American and hire American.” Trump has yet to follow his own rule: his Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida has continued to hire foreign workers even after he won the White House.",2017-01-20T19:00:33Z,News
123,trump,"Senators delay 'rushed' confirmation vote for president's pick to run CIA Dissatisfied by Mike Pompeo’s answers on surveillance issues, Democrats said job was too important to be subject of ‘rubber stamp’ hearing on inauguration dayDonald Trump sworn in as 45th president – live coverage Senate Democrats have delayed the confirmation of Donald Trump’s nominee to run the CIA, saying that job was too important to be the subject of a “rubber stamp” hearing on the day of the presidential inauguration. In the first skirmish between congressional Democrats and the White House over national security of the Trump era, senators Ron Wyden, Patrick Leahy and Richard Blumenthal said that they opposed a “rushed” confirmation for Mike Pompeo that Republicans had bundled with two other security-related nominees. Wyden, Leahy and Blumenthal said that no CIA director had ever been confirmed on the day of a presidential inauguration, adding in a statement: “The importance of the position of CIA Director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated.” The senators said: “Our constituents expect Congress to be a check and balance on the incoming administration, not a rubber stamp.” Wyden was dissatisfied by answers Pompeo provided to the committee on two major surveillance questions: Pompeo’s Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing for the “collection of all metadata” to be assembled into “a comprehensive, searchable database”; and on the propriety of the CIA receiving information on Americans collected by foreign powers. The Senate intelligence committee had been due to vote on Pompeo’s confirmation on Friday alongside that of retired marine generals James Mattis, tasked to run the Pentagon, and John Kelly, tapped to run the Department of Homeland Security. According to an aide, Wyden is stopping short of blocking Pompeo’s nomination outright. Instead, Wyden aims to delay the vote until after the weekend to provide the Senate an extended period to debate Pompeo. The votes on Mattis and Kelly will not be affected by the delayed vote on Pompeo, and both are expected to receive confirmation from the Senate. Pompeo, a Kansas Republican congressman set to run an agency with which Trump has openly feuded, sought during his confirmation hearing last week to smooth over his more controversial proposals. In written responses to Wyden, Pompeo backed away from his proposed hoard of metadata, repeatedly saying, “My op-ed was designed to provide general thoughts on the types of information that may be helpful in protecting the country. I did not propose a full legislative framework that would govern exact access to such information, the restrictions on searches and dissemination, or retention time frames.” Additionally, Pompeo appeared to give a contradictory answer about the propriety of a foreign government providing the CIA with communications concerning Americans against whom there were no warrants. Pompeo told Wyden at the hearing: “The same set of rules that surround the information if it were collected by the US government apply to information that becomes available as – as a result of collection from non-US sources, as well.” But in correspondence with the committee, Pompeo wrote that it was “appropriate” for the CIA to receive such intelligence on Americans “without the same requirements that would apply if the CIA itself were to collect the information”. Pompeo also repeatedly pledged to follow laws currently banning torture and bulk domestic phone records collection. But some Democrats worry that a justice department under Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, would provide legal reinterpretations to reconcile both practices within current statutory prohibitions, similar to its behavior during the Bush administration.",2017-01-20T18:47:01Z,News
124,trump,"New US administration unlikely to be awed by China's year-end spurt GDP growth improved to 6.8% but only after a 19% increase in public investment and a lighter touch on real estate borrowing The silver lining in China’s disappointing 2016 growth figures was the pickup in performance at the end of the year. Or so it seems. Annualised GDP growth improved to hit 6.8% in the final three months of 2016, compared with the previous quarter’s 6.7%, in a show of strength that a wary Donald Trump will see as further evidence of Beijing’s trading prowess. It is unlikely, however, that the new White House administration will miss the startling fact that it took a 19% increase in public investment and a lighter touch on real estate borrowing to reverse, if only for one quarter, the fortunes of the world’s second largest economy. Without an injection of government funds and higher borrowing by construction companies and developers, both of which Trump plans to emulate, China’s growth would likely have been outside the 6.5% to 7% target range it set itself. As it was, an assessment of 2016 found that its full-year performance was still the weakest in nearly three decades. Beijing and the US are on different paths though. It is widely thought that a Trump stimulus will overload an economy already running at full capacity - think of the obese diner eating a wafer thin mint in Monty Python’s Meaning of Life - while Beijing is managing a long decline in growth as it attempts to wean itself off the diminishing returns from export-led growth. Alarm bells ring when the slowdown is too strong and unemployment begins to grow. President Xi Jinping has reacted to this by switching on the public sector spending taps. Analysts said house prices also surged, but regulators are taking steps to cool the market, which will depress this year’s performance. Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics, said: “China cannot adjust to a more sustainable system without pain. Reforms will be deflationary and cannot happen with an overvalued currency.” She expects a 10% devaluation in the yuan this year if Beijing reins in lending. A devaluation might go unnoticed in Washington for a while, but with Trump threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese goods if the dollar strengthens against the yuan, it could spark a disastrous trade war.",2017-01-20T15:21:20Z,News

126,trump,"Davos 2017: what we learned at the WEF Banks got a warm welcome, Britain got a cool reception and climate change fears abounded at the World Economic Forum They’re terrified of Trump Donald Trump has been on everyone’s mind, even though he has been on the other side of the Atlantic this week preparing for his inauguration. Most criticism of the incoming US president was firmly off the record, showing that no one wants to be caught in the firing line of @realdonaldtrump’s Twitter feed. One insider said some US executives are nervous of being seen posing with Chinese leaders, in case the Oval Office saw this as unpatriotic. Banks are off the hook Banks, particularly those stationed in the City of London, have been the unexpected beneficiaries of the new mood of populism sweeping the west. Having been treated as pariahs for causing the global financial crisis, banks are now wooed by all and sundry. The UK government is keen to reassure Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the other Wall Street names that they’ll still be able to operate in the London, while European leaders see the opportunity to steal jobs. Banks are fully aware they’re no longer on the naughty step, and have been dropping hints that they’ll leave London if they don’t get the deal they want. Predictions are out, unless you’re Soros Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of advertising giant WPP, said he was out of the forecasting game after confidently predicting at last year’s Davos that Hillary Clinton would be US president and Brexit would never happen. This year, the chastened Mystic Megs of Davos were reluctant to put their credentials on the line by calling the French presidential election, for example. But George Soros – still making headines at 86 – retains the nerve to predict that markets will soon fall, Theresa May won’t last long, and that US checks and balances will stop Trump being a dictator. We wouldn’t put much money on another Soros idea – that Britain might quit the EU on a Friday and rejoin on a Monday. Britain gets a cool reception Theresa May and Philip Hammond had the unenviable task of explaining to the overwhelmingly pro-remain crowd at Davos what the government was up to now that the decision had gone the other way. Perhaps understandably, May’s reception was cool rather than rapturous – even though she sought to reassure her audience that her vision was a global Britain rather than a siege economy. Hammond didn’t help the mood by repeatedly hinting that Britain could slash taxes and burn regulations if it doesn’t get what it wants. Martin Wolf of the FT got a laugh by calling this the “Singapore-on-Thames” option – but Europe doesn’t get the joke. Yesterday’s men flock to Davos Enoch Powell was wrong when he said every political career ends in failure. For some washed-up politicians, it ends in Davos. George Osborne, a WEF darling only 12 months ago, has gone from debating the global economy with Christine Lagarde to posing with the Clooneys at a swanky drinks reception. Davos’s nightlife is a great chance to relive Oxford student days, and Osborne was seen enjoying a scotch at PR magnate Matthew Freud’s bash at a private chalet at the Schatzalp hotel, only reachable by funicular railway. Other one-time political heavyweights who couldn’t keep away included David Cameron, widely criticised this week for holding the EU referendum, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Climate change fears abound Campaigners are worried that the years of slow progress made on climate change are going to melt away once Trump is in the White House. Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg spoke for many when she warned that Trump might simply not implement the Paris agreement, to keep global warming “well below” 2C. Activists at Davos told us they were keeping a very close eye on the Trump administration, fearing it will alter or make unavailable vital climate change data. China is flexing its muscles At Davos you know a speaker is a real draw if they manage to fill both the cavernous conference hall and also the overspill room. That was the case for Chinese president Xi Jinping’s opening address, seen as an attempt by Beijing to seize the mantle of cheerleader for globalisation from Washington. The word on the floor is that China isn’t ready to dislodge the US – and might not win a trade war either. But it was dominating Davos, with Alibaba’s Jack Ma signing a massive Olympic sponsorship deal and chiding America for wasting money on its military rather than spending it on infrastructure. One spin-off for the local economy was that Xi’s 200-strong delegation required 100 drivers, which usually cost 10,000 Swiss francs for a week. Is Sadiq the new Boris? Sadiq Khan packed a lot into just 20 hours at Davos this year. When he wasn’t telling bank chiefs and politicians that London is open for business, he was racing from TV camera to microphone to liveblog to warn that a hard Brexit would rip Britain apart. Labour hasn’t had a lot to cheer about recently, but winning the mayoralty was one bright spot. Judging by UK businesses’ reaction to Khan this week, London chose the right man to fight its corner through the Brexit negotiations. He wouldn’t be the first politician to use City Hall – and Davos – as a stepping stone for bigger things.",2017-01-20T14:14:38Z,News
127,trump,"Why my seat at the inauguration is empty I will not be celebrating the swearing-in of a president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House The peaceful transition of power is a hallmark of American democracy – a foundational principle that I honor and respect. On Friday, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. The crowning moment of an American presidency is the inauguration: a special occasion designed in many ways to celebrate the incoming administration. I will not be celebrating the swearing-in of a president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House. Instead of attending the inauguration, I will be planning and organizing for resistance. President-elect Trump ran one of the most divisive and prejudiced campaigns in modern history. He began his campaign by insulting Mexican immigrants, pledging to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and then spent a year and a half denigrating communities of color and normalizing bigotry. He denigrated women, stoked Islamophobia and attacked a Gold Star family. He mocked a disabled reporter and appealed to people’s worst instincts. After the election, I hoped the president-elect would turn toward unifying our country. After all, he said it was “time for us to come together”. Despite my unwavering reservations about his candidacy and fitness for office, I encouraged my constituents to have faith that our constitution, our democracy and the voices of the American people would prevail. Sadly, the president-elect has done nothing of the sort; he has instead shown us that he will utilize the same tools of division he employed on the campaign trail as our nation’s commander-in-chief. President-elect Trump has named Steve Bannon his chief strategist, a man who proudly gave the “alt-right” and white nationalism a platform in his leadership role at Breitbart. He has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions to the office of attorney general, despite his long career of opposition to civil and human rights. To make matters worse, after the intelligence community reported Russian interference in our election, the president-elect frequently and forcefully defended Vladimir Putin. He insulted senior intelligence officials in order to preserve his reputation and disguise the truth. Last week it became clearer than ever before that the president-elect is not concerned about being presidential. On the eve of Dr Martin Luther King Jr’s memorial weekend he took to Twitter to insult the legendary civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, tweeting that he was “all talk and no action”. Congressman John Lewis nearly gave his life in the fight for civil rights and human rights. He was instrumental in the passage of the Voting Rights Act and he has spent decades in Congress fighting on behalf of his constituents. He should be applauded for speaking out, not criticized. The president-elect has continuously shown that he will govern as he campaigned with no regard for consequence. Dr Martin Luther King Jr once said: “A time comes when silence is betrayal.” Now is not the time for us to be silent. We must join together and refuse to allow this vision for our country to go unchallenged. We must resist. I hope my empty seat at the inauguration sends a message to my constituents and millions across the country that they have allies in Congress who will resist the agenda that targets the most vulnerable and marginalized, rolls back civil rights and prioritizes millionaires and billionaires over everyday Americans. And that no matter the opposition, we are prepared to defend our nation and its fundamental values on day one of the Trump presidency.",2017-01-20T10:30:05Z,Opinion

129,trump,"Too much love: Nigel Farage and friends have a bad boys' ball in DC In a hotel overlooking the White House, revellers wondered if the other half of the ‘beautiful friendship’ would arrive On the top floor of a very grand hotel overlooking the White House, the Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, is introducing the guest of honour to an enraptured throng of party guests. He has fondest memories of August, when Nigel Farage told a crowd of 10,000 Mississippians all about Brexit. “They were fired up,” Phil explained. “They were drinking the Kool-Aid, and they were licking the jar.” Not sure Phil fully gets the Kool-Aid thing. Still, please welcome Nigel Farage and his entourage (hereafter the enfarage). “We got the bad boys of Brexit here!” hollers Phil. The aforementioned bad boys comprise Farage, Arron Banks, the insurance millionaire who funded Leave.EU’s campaign, and Arron’s communications chief, Andy Wigmore (though they seem to have let a grateful-looking Lord Ashcroft be one for the night). During the EU referendum period, your correspondent once referred to them in passing as “the provisional wing of the leave campaign”, a designation they liked so much they began including it on press releases. Good to see a Washington party in aid of a provisional wing again. You don’t get as many of those to the pound as you used to. At this one, everybody’s drinking liberal tears daiquiris and explaining how the right “haven’t caught a break in America since Reagan”, except for the man giving me an unsolicited history lesson. “Abraham Lincoln,” he is saying, “who was a guy who was our president a long long time ago” – “Hang on. Let me just write his name down so I don’t forget it. How are you spelling Lincoln?” Later, a woman looks darkly over at the White House. “The one thing I am so happy about,” she hisses, “is that this is THEIR last night in there.” Overall party vibe? The West Wing for people who think you could have got an episode over a lot quicker if you just stopped the endless yakking and bombed Haiti / called the Danish president a fat bitch / started a land war in Asia. But we already knew that smirking in front of a gold door is the new talking while walking in corridors. I wouldn’t like to hazard precisely what percentage of the guests the hosts had ever clapped eyes on before tonight. But the event may well be the equivalent of the guy who shows up to his school reunion in a chauffeur-driven Bentley (hired) with two girlfriends (also hired). “Have you ever seen so many people gathered in one place in order to be rich, powerful and disgusting together?” wondered Don DeLillo in the fictionalised account of Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball that appeared in his novel Underworld. The week before this Washington gathering, I sent Banks a long account of the Black and White Ball. Having read it, he pronounced: “That is exactly what our party’s going to be like.” That’s not all he said. In fact, the last time I heard this much about the minutiae of a coming soiree I was reading Mrs Dalloway. Of course, there is the odd departure from the novel. Unlike Clarissa Dalloway, whose to-do list doesn’t involve a whole lot more than buying flowers, the enfarage prepared for the evening with a round of media appearances. They’re so keen to complete the Washington platform game that they even fitted in a trip to lay a wreath at the national war cemetery in Arlington, having discovered that a single Briton was helpful enough to have been buried there. There were also conversations with movie people to discuss optioning Banks’s book – The Bad Boys of Brexit – for development as a motion picture. The enfarage tell me they’re in negotiations to get the House of Cards writer Michael Dobbs to do the script. “He should be here somewhere,” says Andy. Maybe he’s in the loo with the incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn – also said to be “around somewhere”. Guest list-wise, then, I’d say Capote just about had the edge, even if he did break off from conversation with Greta Garbo to beg Sinatra not to leave in the small hours. The enfarage wanted the Trump strategist Steve Bannon; they got the Cameron strategist Steve Hilton. When you’ve decided the way to matter is to be near to people who matter … well, I guess it matters if you can only muster the rank-and-file of the DC arseoisie. This week in Washington, the success of a party is measured in how much power is concentrated in its attendees. Naturally, everyone wants the big one. Every host is essentially throwing an extravagant party for dreadful people in the desperate hope that a certain someone will come. Think of it all as The Great Twatsby. “Is Donald coming?” asks a miniskirted judge who has a show on Fox News. “Don’t know,” says Andy, though I think we do. At different points during the evening, various men are presumed to be secret service operatives covertly sweeping the room, but Trump’s failure to materialise – either via the door or through a haunted mirror – suggests they were actually just guests with shifty eyes and really thick necks. Thus it was up to Nigel – who can only be days off a mid-Atlantic accent – to provide the box office. “Donald Trump,” he told the room, “is the only person I have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert.” What about Russell Brand on Question Time, when he called you a pound shop Enoch Powell? But of course, no one here saw that show. And in case the party guests had heard any other fake news folklore about the teetotal president-elect’s best lapdog, Nigel would like to set them straight. In the years before Brexit, he didn’t “spend several hours a day drowning my sorrows with English beer – though if you read the British press that’s what you think I did”. Of course, there is a rich tradition of Brits relishing the chance to lose their baggage on an Atlantic crossing. Not their luggage, you understand, but of all the bits of their backstory that they’d like to consign to oblivion. When David Beckham went to play for LA Galaxy, his wife, Victoria, basically got on the plane with Wag hair extensions, and got off it a sophisticated fashion designer. And so with Farage, who is no longer the man who failed to get elected to parliament seven times – and certainly not the wobbler who conceded no less than twice on referendum night itself. He isn’t the guy who the official leave campaign believe not only failed to persuade anyone who wasn’t already going to vote for them, but actively put off those who might otherwise have done so. We lost contact with that guy somewhere over the Bermuda Triangle. Nigel is now Mr Brexit. He is all dressed up and doing Washington. Indeed, there was much to enjoy in guest explanations for why Farage had just mingled off out of their conversational orbit. “I think what it is,” declares one man, “is that he gets so much love – so much love – that sometimes he just needs to take a moment.” Mm. He took a moment fairly swiftly after one couple presented him with a highly covetable piece of man jewellery: a chunky Donald Trump ring. In the end, the point of the party seemed to be to remind everyone that this is a love story. “Y’all have something called a blind date in the UK?” Governor Bryant asked me. “You know a blind date, where you set up two beautiful people? Well I had these two guys – the two guys in the western world who most needed to meet each other. I had Nigel, who was Mr Brexit. And I had this tremendous hero, who was going to be the president of the United States. And I had to get them together. It was the start of a beautiful friendship.” A friendship, anyway. What feels a little poignant is Nigel’s willingness these days to make Brexit a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump. “I agree with Trump,” he said in one of several variations on a theme. “Brexit is great, but Trump is Brexit plus plus plus.” Where Nigel goes, others follow. Bryant says he turned to his wife as the Brexit result came through, and said: “That was Trump’s first victory.” Well done, Donald. No doubt he’d have liked to be here tonight. Certainly, he’d have recognised the self-dramatisation that underpins all these sort of parties. Made it ma! Top o’ the world! Or at least, top of a hotel really very near the White House. I don’t want to get all Seven Ages of Parties here, but there seems to be a point where you graduate from wanting the hot girls or boys to come to your parties and start wanting the funny girls and boys to come. Then eventually, some people start wanting a four-star general they’ve never met to show up. I wonder if the regular attendees of these things truly love them, or if the memory of genuine fun occasionally twitches like a phantom limb?",2017-01-20T09:00:28Z,News
130,trump,"Social workers can help cure ailing democracies Social services and welfare systems offer ways of restoring missing links in politics: community cohesion and solidarity Donald Trump’s inauguration as president will deepen the concern he has already caused among vulnerable communities in the US and globally. The commitments he made during his campaign for the White House – rolling back state health and social care, undermining the human rights of refugees and immigrants, and escalating global tensions – pose an immense danger to all the communities social workers engage with. The vote propelling Trump to the presidency illustrates how basic and flawed our democratic systems are. It demands a new urgency to strengthen community solidarity and expand the social work profession’s key role in supporting the systems of social protection that are required for people’s participation in democratic systems. The real winner in the election was clearly the culture of abstention among voters and their alienation from the systems that control their day-to-day lives and futures. While Hillary Clinton received a fractionally higher proportion of votes than Donald Trump, 42.2% of eligible voters did not engage in the electoral process. A further 7.8% of people were prevented from voting – meaning that in total 50% of people did not participate in the democratic process. This outcome represents a massive failure in people’s engagement in the political systems that dominate their lives. Social workers are acutely aware that voting every four years in the secrecy of a private booth, without further involvement in the political process, is the weakest form of democracy. It does not secure the kind of democracy and political structures needed to engage people’s involvement in the environments that dictate their health, security, rights and future wellbeing. Such limited democratic processes lack the interest and ability to foster interaction and engagement between people. This simple concept of democracy only asks people to say “yes” or “no” to a political future in which they are not engaged. Instead of interaction, people are subjected to manipulative political arguments that blame other races or nations for their disadvantage and discomfort. The consequence is disengagement, disillusion and alienation from the structures that people need to be involved with. Such alienation is compounded by inequality between the establishment and people seeking justice because of flawed social policies. The underlying motive of politics is to protect the status quo rather than working together to find solutions to problems. Social workers have consistently advocated the active involvement of people and communities in shaping our environment. This is a part of the profession’s belief that oppression and difficulties must be addressed at their root cause and not just at the level of symptoms. The role of social workers is enabling solidarity in families and between groups to develop inclusive systems and structures that respect the dignity of all people. It is therefore natural for us to advocate the development of active and engaging democratic structures, which support people’s participation in decision-making. The International Federation of Social Workers promotes the development in all countries of legislation that recognises the importance of community involvement in building real democratic structures. From a social work perspective, social services and welfare systems should be key platforms in building community cohesion and solidarity. Focusing on prevention rather than symptom relief, social services should bring communities together to actively participate and shape societies for the benefit of everyone. The social work contribution is to use our skills to bring people together into self-reliant, confident families and communities. That a minority of US citizens voted for Trump reflects that this is not a healthy democracy, but nor is this an isolated situation. Brexit, the growth of polarised political parties, the intensification of racism, blaming refugees, discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity are all consequences of political actions based on fear – not on the real engagement with people based on listening, understanding and working together for better solutions. The challenges generated by such limited versions of democracy have implications for the social work profession. In response, we continue to reinforce our focus on fostering community support systems. We champion the building of solidarity between people and efforts to support the voices of communities. We work with governments, presenting evidence on the benefits of building social capital to achieve economic and social sustainability. We join the demonstrations and movements linking people together in the call for real democracy and the recognition of all people’s rights. We speak together saying “no” to governance of the people and “yes” to governance by the people. Join the Social Care Network to read more pieces like this.

131,trump,"Australia’s conservative government fiddles on climate policy while the country burns When Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott as prime minister, serious action on global warming was hoped for – but almost nothing has changed Australia’s January news has been full of official reports of record-breaking extreme weather devastating our ecosystems on land and in the sea and government ministers suggesting we build new coal-fired power stations, provide billion-dollar subsidised loans to rail lines for new coal mega-mines, increase coal exports to reduce temperature rises and reduce our ambitions for renewable power. The disconnect is glaring but perhaps dimmed in the eyes of some readers because Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. The Coalition government – which boasts as one of its proudest achievements the repeal of the former government’s emissions trading scheme – has a particular need for doublespeak. Having run two election campaigns on the pledge of “axing the tax” with hyperbolic assertions that it would strangle the economy and impoverish households, it found it convenient to claim the discovery of the climate policy equivalent of a free lunch. The Coalition has never resolved the bitter internal divisions with conservative climate doubters that saw Malcolm Turnbull overthrown as leader in 2009 owing to his support for carbon pricing, to be replaced by Tony Abbott, who had declared the settled science of climate change to be “crap” and believed coal was “good for humanity”. In September 2015 Turnbull overthrew Abbott but, since then, climate change has barely rated a mention and the new prime minister has surprised many by apparently falling into line with the mineral industry’s argument that our coal exports are really doing the world a big favour. Trump’s victory has emboldened the doubters – the resources minister, Matt Canavan, for example, enthused that “Donald Trump is good for fossil fuels, good for steel and good for Australia”. But it has also coincided with more conflicting responses from the government. Less than a day after the US election, the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement – the same agreement the new US president has vowed to “tear up” and that calls for zero net emissions by the second half of the century – describing it was a “watershed … that has galvanised global action”. But then it promptly abandoned a domestic policy idea that represented its last credible chance of meeting its promised targets or galvanising any real action here. With the world recording its third year in a row of record temperatures and the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, any objective assessment would suggest the time for prevarication and obfuscation is long since past. We’ll soon see. On 1 February, in his first major speech for the year, Turnbull will stand before the National Press Club to explain his policy on energy and the greenhouse gases it produces. Experts from business, industry and the environment movement are wondering what he can possibly say. For years the former environment minister had privately reassured stakeholders that a 2017 review would quietly morph the Direct Action policy into a so-called emissions intensity trading scheme and business and environment groups alike were clinging to those promises as the last hope for a credible climate policy and an end to the investment drought caused by years of mindless “climate wars” and policy uncertainty. But late last year, despite advice that such a scheme would lead to lower household power prices, despite having bipartisan support and just hours after the current environment minister said the review would look at it, the government ruled it out. Turnbull will announce new vehicle emissions standards and a new energy efficiency scheme. He and his office are looking at “technological solutions” – bright new ideas in solar thermal, or battery or carbon storage technology that might fill the policy void. But all those technologies need government policies to provide investors with incentives and certainty, and without actually confronting the climate doubters no one can imagine what that policy might be. Turnbull will also reassure voters, who repeatedly tell pollsters they are worried about global warming, that Australia will “meet and beat” its international targets, as it has in the past. But again complexity hides the underwhelming truth. Australia got not one but two special deals in the original Kyoto protocol – an allowance to increase its emissions in absolute terms – unlike almost all other developed countries, on account of our reliance on fossil fuels – and another special deal so particular to our circumstances it was called “the Australia clause”. It allowed the inclusion of land-use changes in emission calculations in a way that meant restrictions that had already been imposed on large-scale land clearing – especially in Queensland – allowed Australia to rest assured it had achieved its new target before it even signed up to it. The deal was so good we did “meet and beat” the target and, unlike almost all other developed countries, we are using that overshoot to help us also meet our very low 2020 target. But now state governments are overturning land-clearing restrictions and the federal government is arguing that states should abandon their regional renewable energy targets, which were only ever necessary because the federal scheme is effectively winding down. In short, we have done very little and we have no effective federal policies to shift to a low emissions economy, and everyone knows it. Trump gives the Australian sceptics the chance to run the same old arguments – if the US does nothing, then why should we? His victory has increased the prospect that some of them could split to form a new conservative party. The energy market remains so complex that all kinds of wild claims can be made to justify a do-nothing end. And international climate negotiations remain so byzantine that countries can claim hero status while doing very little. But the reality of global warming cannot be disguised by political obfuscation and the Turnbull government has run out of excuses. It has to have an honest internal reckoning – is it serious about climate policy or does it run with the sceptics? Trump’s election makes it more urgent that we finally have an honest debate.",2017-01-20T04:09:03Z,News
132,trump,"Buy, George? World's largest fund manager hires Osborne as adviser Former chancellor’s lucrative new role as BlackRock adviser follows controversial US speaking tour that netted £600,000 George Osborne is taking on a lucrative six-figure role as an adviser to BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager. The former chancellor has already earned considerable amounts in the private sector since Theresa May sacked him as chancellor, with speeches to Wall Street banks helping to make him the highest earning MP in 2016. He has not yet revealed how much he will earn in his BlackRock role, but he will have to declare the amount in the MPs register of interests. He will remain as the Conservative MP for Tatton – but the timing of the announcement, hours before the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, infuriated Labour. Osborne’s fees from US appearances during the autumn topped £600,000, including £85,396.24 from Citibank for two speeches, £34,109.14 from BlackRock and £68,125.35 from Centerbridge Partners, a private investment firm. Osborne will work as an adviser at BlackRock’s investment institute which provides research for the investment managers. The New York-based firm oversees $5.1tn (£4.2tn) of investments for pensioners and savers. It is one of the biggest investors in companies on the stock market and is usually among the top three shareholders in FTSE 100 companies. Osborne will take on his advisory role at the firm where his former chief of staff, Rupert Harrison, is a strategist, and will work several days a month. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, said Osborne had “a unique and invaluable perspective on the issues that are shaping our world today”. “At the centre of our mission is helping people around the world save and invest for retirement, and George’s insights will help our clients achieve their goals,” said Fink, who was paid $26m last year. Both men have been attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, where Osborne has also been speaking at a number of events, including one for Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC. “BlackRock wants better outcomes for pensioners and savers, and I want to help them deliver that,” Osborne said. “It’s a chance for me to work part-time with one of the world’s most respected firms and a major employer in Britain.” John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, suggested the announcement’s proximity to Trump’s inauguration was “interesting timing”. However, a source close to Osborne said the timing was determined by an announcement by the advisory committee on business appointments, the government body that considers job moves for former ministers and senior civil servants. McDonnell said: “It looks like the former chancellor also seems to think that after Theresa May’s speech this week it’s looking like a bankers’ Brexit is what the Tories have in mind for our country. “But in the communities that have been hit hardest by his austerity policies of the last six years, people will wonder, are we all still in it together?” Osborne starts his job at the institute, which is run by Philipp Hildebrand, the former Swiss central bank governor and now BlackRock’s vice-chairman, on 1 February. He will provide “perspectives on European politics and policy, Chinese economic reform, and trends such as low yields and longevity and their impact on retirement planning”. He will not be involved in lobbying the UK government, BlackRock said. The announcement of his appointment came during a week in which the usually publicity-shy fund management firm spoke out about the level of executive pay by writing to the 350 biggest companies on the stock market to demand cuts to director pension entitlements and clear explanations for big pay rises for company bosses. The appointment also comes after Osborne’s fellow Conservative William Hague, who did not stand as an MP at the last election, took on a role at the US bank Citigroup and another Osborne former chief of staff, Thea Rogers, took on a “policy and communications” job at the takeaway app company Deliveroo.",2017-01-20T15:53:41Z,News
133,trump,"Gove’s ‘snowflake’ tweet is symptomatic of the nastiness that’s ruining politics Twitter storms, online spats and insults are making it impossible to talk to one another and reach the compromises on which public life depends There’s a new consensus about what social media is doing to public life: it’s making us meaner to each other. From behind a screen, we have the licence to be nasty to strangers, insult celebrities and swear at politicians. It’s fuelling misunderstanding and catalysing the spread of fake news. And because of self-reinforcing algorithms and the logic of friendship networks, we’re all cocooned with like-minded people and news we already agree with. Cyber-psychologists have known all this for ages. In 1990, the American lawyer and author Mike Godwin proposed a natural law of the behaviour of Usenet newsgroup conversations: “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.” In short, the more you talk online, the more likely you’ll be nasty; talk long enough, and it’s a certainty. (Godwin’s law can easily be observed today on newspapers’ online comment threads.) A little later, the American academic John Suler was studying the behaviour of participants in early online chat rooms. He found that participants tended to be more aggressive and angry online than off. This was, he said, because when we’re protected by a screen, the usual social restrictions, responsibilities and norms don’t apply. We don’t know or see the people we’re speaking to, and they don’t know or see us. And because it all takes place in what feels like an alternate reality, we do things we wouldn’t in real life. Suler called this the “online disinhibition effect”. Back then, no one really listened to any of this because most of us weren’t online. But that’s all changed. People knowingly talk about “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers” over the dinner table. Liberals complain that Trump supporters are stuck in a fake news filter bubble, while Conservatives mock the liberals stuck in their elite echo chamber. This understanding is all at least partly true, but it involves always pinning the blame on someone else. However, communication is a two-way street. True, social media makes us more impulsive, less physically connected to the people we insult, and more likely to be rude. But it also affords the chance to get offended; 15 minutes on Facebook and you can rile yourself up nicely. If you want it, social media offers endless excuses to be outraged and angry. And why not? Being offended and outraged by someone else’s 140 characters is a perfectly pleasant sensation. I suspect a lot of people are quietly happy when they read something online they dislike. It provides a warm feeling of righteous indignation, and the chance to attack your enemies for being so damn ignorant and narrow-minded. In so doing you can express your own, morally superior, view. Said outrage can be put to political use. Which leads me to Conservative MP Michael Gove. It is in fact of little relevance whether Boris Johnson did or did not compare François Hollande to a Nazi guard earlier this week. You can’t blame “online disinhibition” for it: Johnson said this offline, at a speech in India. Back in 2002 he described black people as “piccaninnies” in a column; in 2006 Papua New Guineans were cannibals and chief killers. Johnson is unique in that he appears to have online disinhibition even when he is not online. What is relevant, though, is what followed this week: waves of pointless and escalating outrage. Some people online were upset by Johnson’s remark. They thought it was crass. Jackpot! Gove was upset that some people online were upset. He tweeted: “People ‘offended’ by the foreign secretary’s comments today are humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes – it’s a witty metaphor #getalife”. Snowflake has become the shorthand rightwing – or libertarian – derogatory term for leftwing people who are easily offended. It’s a very easy way to dismiss opponents’ concerns. People who thought the foreign secretary might consider watching his words during delicate EU negotiations are thin-skinned idiots. Unlike Gove, who is a muscular liberal, an arch defender of free speech. But the snowflakes hit back. Gove was being intentionally and unnecessarily divisive. They were upset that Gove was upset that some people were upset. And on and on down the chain went the upset. Like the Capulets and Montagues, the original point of disagreement was swiftly forgotten. The feud fed itself, and both sides walked away feeling slightly more angry than when they started. This is why social media is making the business of politics nastier. Almost every politician is online. They are subject to the same feelings of mild outrage and anger as we all are. In a world of social media spats and Twitter storms, your opponents can’t simply hold a principled, different opinion. They must be bad. They must be incoherent babblers, sinister Machiavellians, politically correct elites, or hoodwinked buffoons. And they’re everywhere, these people! This makes compromise more difficult, since compromise depends on accepting that the people you disagree with hold their principled opinions in good faith. And without compromise, there is no politics. But it’s not “them” – those idiots on Twitter and Facebook – who are the problem. It’s also “us”, who secretly enjoy finding them, and sharing our outrage and moral rectitude with the world.",2017-01-20T12:44:10Z,Opinion
134,trump,"Monet, Renoir and a £44.2m Munch … billionaire opens Potsdam art gallery Software firm founder Hasso Plattner launches his Barberini Museum, west of Berlin, with Impressionism show A German software billionaire is opening a new art museum in the former imperial city of Potsdam on Friday, having reconstructed an 18th-century palace, destroyed in the second world war, to house the works. Hasso Plattner, a co-founder of the multinational software company SAP, described the Barberini Museum as his gift to the city and “one of the most important things” he had done in his life. The privately funded gallery occupies three floors of the building, which is in the heart of Potsdam, south-west of Berlin. Among the star exhibits will be Edvard Munch’s Girls on the Bridge, a depiction of transition to adulthood, which was sold at Sotheby’s auction house in New York last November for $54.5m (£44.2m), and is widely believed to have been bought by Plattner. The electrical engineer has refused to either confirm or deny the reports, but proudly pointed out the painting in the gallery during a preview this week. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, will be among the list of prominent guests at the museum’s grand opening, where John Fogerty, the former frontman and guitarist of the rock band Creedance Clearwater Revival will hold a concert. The debut exhibition, Impressionism: The Art of Landscape and Modern Art Classics, includes key works by Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Wassily Kandinsky, Max Liebermann and Edvard Munch, many of which come from Plattner’s own collection which he has amassed over 20 years, and a large number which are on loan from international museums. The museum also includes a “smart wall” where visitors can forensically examine most of the collection’s paintings, which have been reproduced in images of 200m pixels. The Barberini’s inauguration marks the end of years of strife. Disputes over everything from what Plattner was allowed to exhibit to where the museum should be built have long made headline news. The project nearly foundered on several occasions. At one point Plattner threatened to retract his offer to give Potsdam its first new art gallery for 250 years, due to fears over new controversial heritage protection legislation. Under the Kulturgutschutzgesetz or national protection of cultural property law, Plattner risked having works from his own private art collection – which will be displayed in rotating exhibitions – confiscated by the German state if he tried to take them out of the country back to his home in Palo Alto, California, or sold them outside Germany. He has now reached an agreement with the cultural ministry which partially lifts the restrictions, but the fragile pact is believed to be one of the reasons he is being cautious about stating which of the works belong to him. At another stage in the planning Plattner proposed building the gallery on the site of a 60-metre high East Germany-era hotel, which the city had planned to destroy. But the backlash locally was enormous, leading to threats towards Plattner and accusations claiming he was among the increasing numbers of rich elite buying up the city and willing the destruction of a building held in great affection by many Potsdamers, not least because it symbolised a lost past. The Barberini completes the historic rebuilding of Potsdam’s Alter Markt square, which also includes a reconstructed baroque building housing the parliament for the state of Brandenburg. Leading art figures have said they expect it to have a big impact on the German museum landscape. The costs of reconstructing the historic facade and creating a modern airy interior for the palace – originally built by Frederick the Great who modelled it on the Palazzo Barberini in Rome – are estimated to have been more than €60m. The funding was provided by Plattner’s foundation, which also finances Germany’s only IT systems engineering university, also in Potsdam. Plattner, a Berliner who celebrates his 73rd birthday on Friday, left IBM in 1972 to co-found SAP, which is now the world’s third largest software and programming company. He is a member of The Giving Pledge, a group of billionaire philanthropists who promise to give half their wealth to charity during their lifetime or in a will. Plattner said: “I always wanted to make a museum. Berlin is blessed with state and private museums, and now Potsdam can make its presence felt with the Barberini.” Referring to the battles he had faced over his project, he said: “I can only put it down to the character flaw of jealousy and envy in us Germans. People originally told me to shut up, we don’t need another museum. But I hope the doubters will soon see what it gives to the city by bringing art lovers here in their droves as well as putting the finishing touches to recreating the historic centre of Potsdam.” The museum’s director, Ortrud Westheider, who previously ran the private gallery Bucerius in Hamburg, said the Barberini underlined the importance of putting art “at the heart of life”, saying: “I look forward to being able to continually fill this space with new energy and to give visitors an intimate encounter with original works, as well as establishing a new centre for art history.” She added that she found it poignant that the gallery was opening on the very day “when art institutes in the US feel they have no choice than to go on strike”, referring to the Art Strike by curators and artists in protest at the inauguration of the next US president, Donald Trump. “I think there the mood is far less joyous,” she said.",2017-01-20T04:00:22Z,News
135,trump,"El Chapo is not a Robin Hood but a 'cancerous tumour', US prosecutor says Joaquín Guzmán faces life in US prison and seizure of $14bn drug profitsAlleged drug kingpin pleaded not guilty at New York court hearing Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán could face the rest of his life in a US prison and have $14bn of his drug-trafficking profits seized by American authorities, US prosecutors said on Friday, a day after the cartel kingpin was extradited from Mexico to stand trial in New York. During a brief hearing at the Brooklyn federal court, Guzmán pleaded not guilty to charges that he lead a vast and murderous criminal operation that distributed 200 tons of cocaine for sale on American streets. Wearing a dark blue prison smock and trousers, blue tennis shoes and a light brown T-shirt, Guzmán shuffled into court with his hands behind his back looking subdued. Speaking quietly through a translator, he told judge James Orenstein that he understood the charges against him and the rights he had as a defendant. “Si, señor,” he repeated, in reply to Orenstein’s questions. He declined to apply for bail. Unveiling a 17-count indictment against Guzmán at a press conference on Friday morning, Robert Capers, the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, said Guzmán would be forced to answer for a “life of crime, violence, death and destruction” as the head of the Sinaloa cartel. “Guzmán’s story is not one of a do-gooder, or a Robin Hood, or an escape artist,” said Capers, referring to Guzmán’s record of twice fleeing Mexican prisons. Instead, said Capers, “Guzmán’s rise was akin to that of a small cancerous tumour that metastasized into a full-blown scourge”. Capers said that in addition to decades of drug trafficking, Guzmán had maintained an army of hitmen to commit murders in defence of his network, amassed a military-style arsenal of weapons, and personally carried a gold-plated AK-47 rifle and diamond-encrusted handgun. Standing alongside 20 officials from agencies including the FBI, NYPD, the Department of Homeland Security and the Drug Enforcement Administration, Capers said his announcement was the culmination of more than a decade of investigative work by multiple American authorities. Guzmán was flown into the US on a Mexican law enforcement plane late on Thursday. Officials said that after landing at MacArthur airport on Long Island, he was driven in a 13-vehicle motorcade to the metropolitan correction center in Manhattan, before being moved to Brooklyn at 7am on Friday. Special agent Angel Melendez, of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that for Guzmán “the realisation began to kick in that he was about to face American justice” upon his transfer to the country, which several officials said had taken the US government by surprise on Thursday. “As he deplaned, the most notorious criminal of modern times, as you looked into his eyes you could see the surprise, you could see the shock, and to a certain extent you could see the fear,” said Melendez. Amid speculation that Guzmán’s extradition was a parting gift from Mexico to the Obama administration, or even an early peace offering to incoming US president Donald Trump, Capers declined to comment on whether the timing had political significance. Officials also would not comment on where Guzmán would be detained and on extra precautions being taken to guard the capo, who twice absconded from high-security prisons in Mexico – most recently through a sophisticated underground passageway which led from his cell bathroom. Melendez said to laughter that “no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom”. “What occurred in other countries will not occur here,” said Capers. Following his second escape in 2015, Guzmán was recaptured in a seedy motel in the city of Los Mochis after federal agents trailed the actor Sean Penn to a clandestine meeting with the fugitive kingpin. A 56-page memo filed to court by US authorities on Friday said that prosecutors plan to use at trial “a large coterie of cooperating witnesses”, including dozens of people who claim to have had face-to-face dealings with Guzmán and US-based drug distributors who were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel. One witness is expected to testify about Guzmán’s use of assassins against his rivals, “including his use of a house specially outfitted for murdering victims”, the court filing said. “The house had plastic sheets over the walls to catch spouting blood and a drain in the floor to facilitate the draining of blood.” Other witnesses are said to be prepared to testify about “specific murders carried out under Guzmán’s orders” including the killing of the cocaine trafficker Julio Beltrán, as well as Guzmán’s payment of bribes to Mexican politicians and law enforcement officials. Physical evidence, such as ledgers from Colombian drug cartel bosses detailing agreements with Guzmán, would also be used against him, according to the memo, along with intercepted electronic surveillance of Guzmán and “numerous physical surveillances” in the US and other countries. Authorities requested that Guzmán be detained pending his trial due to the severity of the allegations against him, the threat he posed to the public, and the risk that he would flee the country. Guzmán faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors said in the indictment that the US also intends to seek the forfeiture of at least $14bn in money and property from Guzmán. Capers confirmed that in order to extradite Guzmán, Mexico had required that there was no possibility he would face the death penalty. The Guardian disclosed last year that the US had quietly removed specific murder charges against Guzmán from his charge sheet. A grand jury indictment first filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the outgoing US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was the district’s top federal prosecutor, had charged Guzmán and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels.",2017-01-20T17:09:54Z,News
136,trump,"They call it fun, but the digital giants are turning workers into robots With perfect timing, a new film highlights how employee monitoring is taking over people’s lives “Secrets are lies; sharing is caring; privacy is theft.” So run the three Orwellian aphorisms at the heart of Dave Eggers’ 2013 novel The Circle, whose film version – starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks – will arrive in cinemas this spring. Given that the story centres on an omnipotent hybrid of Google, Twitter and Facebook, and asks exacting questions about their shared vision of the future, the timing is perfect – chiming with rising angst about the digital giants’ imperial approach to information, and the sense that their power and recklessness is now having so-called real-world impacts, and huge ones at that. Such, perhaps, is the zeitgeist of early 2017: tech-fear fusing with terror about Donald Trump and Brexit, leaving millions of us in a state of twitchy anxiety. At the heart of the novel and film is the Circle corporation, whose logo suggests a stylised panopticon, and whose leaders want to shape the world in the image of their Californian HQ. There, privacy and autonomy count for almost nothing. Under a veneer of feelgoodism, employees are complicit in their own constant monitoring and a system of endless appraisal by their peers, who feed into a system called Participation Rank – or PartiRank, for short. The details of their online and offline lives are judged according to “an algorithim-generated number” that measures their activity. “It’s just for fun,” a company high-up tells the story’s principal character. But, of course, it isn’t: that’s just one more example of the passive-aggressive ways of Silicon Valley, underpinned by the insane demands summed up in one of the Circle’s slogans, “Let’s do this. Let’s do all of this.” Even when it was published, The Circle – whose plot is driven by the drive to make the whole of humanity “clear”, or subject to constant online scrutiny – felt less like satire than a pretty accurate portrayal of where advanced societies were headed, particularly in relation to workplace surveillance, and the way it is blurring into the monitoring of the whole of people’s lives. Of course, from the punch-clock to the tyranny of time-and-motion studies, businesses have always tried to maximise control of their workers, usually under the auspices of efficiency. But the digital age has long since allowed this tendency to take mind-boggling forms. I spoke this week to a trade union organiser who works in two key fields: the huge warehouses run by online retail giants, and driver deliveries. In the former, she told me, employees are often tracked so closely that their managers can see if they pause between tasks or, even more unthinkably, stop for a chat with their fellow workers – something betrayed when dots on a GPS machine cluster together. Socialising becomes all but impossible; the idea of meeting a partner at work looks like a laughable relic. Meanwhile, when it comes to anything that involves a human being and a car, van or lorry, the same tracking means productivity must be squeezed out of every second: even stopping at Tesco for a sandwich can be an unwise decision. Fighting all this, I was told, is usually viable only in workplaces with a strong union – and besides, people used to their work being constantly monitored tend to now expect it: as my contact put it, “They don’t think it’s that bad. It seems normal.”These long-standing techniques are now creeping into supposedly higher-ranking jobs. PartiRank may be fictional, but there are no end of real-life equivalents: “platforms” companies can buy in that allow them not just to track their employees’ movements and interactions but to install exactly the kind of continuing, neurotic-looking peer appraisal Eggers wrote about. If you hear the term “people analytics”, worry. Some systems are straightforwardly intrusive: Worksnaps, for example, is an application that can take repeated screenshots of workers’ computers, count their mouse-clicks and take webcam images. Others are more passive-aggressive: BetterWorks uses a Facebook-like application that depends on employees publicly posting their supposed workplace goals, and regularly issuing “cheers” and “nudges” to their colleagues. “In the office of the future,” says the chief executive of the company responsible, “you will always know what you are doing and how fast you are doing it.” The increasing ubiquity of Fitbits – the wearable devices that track how much you walk, the quality of your sleep, your heart rate and more – is of a piece. The US retail chain Target announced in 2015 that Fitbit trackers were to be offered to its 335,000 workers, as part of its embrace of what the business vernacular calls “corporate wellness programmes”. As things stand, workers who opt to have their metabolisms monitored are organised into teams who compete to raise money for charity. Just for fun, then. Until, perhaps, it’s not. If you doubt the sinister elements of what’s going on, consider the case of Myrna Arias, who worked for a Miami-based money exchange company that insisted she download a tracking app on to her phone that logged her whereabouts 24 hours a day. She deleted the app and was fired, leading to legal action that was settled out of court. Or maybe have a look at the story of two parking inspectors in Sydney recently sacked for the content of conversations picked up on their body cameras. Closer to home, according to reports last weekend, a US-based company called Humanyze – nice, that – is working with British businesses including a high street bank and the consulting firm Deloitte, as well as parts of the NHS. On first sight, it is hard to shake off the feeling that what they do must be some sort of joke: their methods are all about “sociometric” badges worn by employees to record their movements, interactions and “speaking patterns”. To quote one account of what that entails: “Humanyze’s badge can track physical activities in real time, capture ‘nonlinguistic social signals such as interest and excitement’ without recording actual words, locate wearers and their proximity to other wearers, and communicate with other electronic devices.” The company says that its work helps companies “enhance teamwork and employee engagement, improve processes, and plan for growth”. What it does to the people who have to wear the badges is so far unclear. In the context of the automated future, what all this means is pretty obvious. On the way to being replaced by a robot, you will have to become one, and tumble into a mode of existence glimpsed 20 years ago on the amazingly prescient Radiohead album OK Computer, in the sound-collage titled Fitter Happier. Intoned by a Stephen Hawking-like speech synthesizer, the words long ago became a grimly funny signifier for modern living: “Fitter, happier / More productive / Comfortable / Not drinking too much / Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week / Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries.” And here we are – with, unbelievably, the selfsame vision now enforced by wraparound surveillance. Judging by the way the idea is sold, the people responsible, for reasons that speak volumes about the tech world’s endless naivety, they see it as a kind of super-efficient utopia. Anyone with a grasp of what makes us human should surely recognise it for what it is: Stasi capitalism, apparently furthering its dominance at a terrifying speed, with only the faintest murmurs of protest.",2017-01-20T16:19:50Z,Opinion
137,trump,"Totes annoying: words that should be banned The internet is the source of many crimes against language – and these are among the worst offenders We all have a watershed word – the word that tells us it’s all over, that the internet has won, and our youth is gone for ever. For me, it was Yolo, or You Only Live Once. It was born, I used it, and rooms fell eerily silent as soon as it left my mouth. Yolo belonged to the others, the younger people; it carbon-dated me and I was envious. You might call it snobbery but, for me, every delicious new bit of slang reminds me I’m being left behind, along with VHS cassettes, legwarmers and Lady Gaga. Susie Dent, Countdown’s resident lexicographer, tells me I should lighten up. “Slang has always moved this way,” she says. “From Cockney rhyming slang to codes swapped among highwaymen, they’re tribal badges of identity, bonding mechanisms designed to distinguish the initiated, and to keep strangers out.” The linguist and author David Crystal agrees: “Remember the old maxim – the chief use of slang is to show you’re one of the gang.” Fine: I’m not one of the gang. But surely even the experts would admit there are some words that urgently need to be retired, or at least restricted to people under 25? “If a term becomes too popular, its irritant value is ramped up,” Dent agrees. “The impulse is then to replace it with something else.” This, then, is my highly subjective glossary of words that should be binned in 2017 – the most annoying, the most misused, the most broken. Is one of these your “Yolo”? It’s a hotly contested field. Because internet “A lot of purists hate this one, but I think it’s quite inventive and useful as a shortcut,” Susie Dent says. The main issue here is a fake sense of guilt. We’re allowed to enjoy cat gifs, videos of people falling over and animations of a horse playing with a chicken without blaming it on the internet. That’s what the internet is for! You’re not above watching a 10-minute supercut of every time Alexis Carrington from Dynasty walked into a room and said “Krystle!” and you shouldn’t pretend otherwise. Because internet? Because you. Totes Here lies the body, but not the soul, of “totally”, bastardised beyond recognition from a gorgeous, absolute adverb into an uber-chilled shrug or nod of the head. Not only that, it has a tendency to take other words down with it. “Totes emosh”, “totes cray”: no syllable is safe. All is not lost, however: so omnipresent is “totes” that your grandmother says it to mean “yes”, which means it should be getting measured up for its wooden overcoat pretty soon. That thing when A shortcut to starring in your very own scene from Seinfeld, “That thing when” attempts to glitter the very dullest of all the concrete: our everyday lives. “That thing when your five-year-old sees Donald Trump on the TV and says he looks like a walnut whip.” “That thing when a girl hits on you in the gym, but you’re married to the weights and gotta say no.” It’s easy to see why it’s popular – “that thing when you sit staring into your phone for hours at a time praying for something, anything, to happen until finally you just make something up” doesn’t quite cut it. Amaze, or awesomesauce Awesomesauce may sound like a ketchup business started by the dullest, most bored and married of your friends, but it’s actually a cutesy way of saying something is great, that you like it. It’s an uncomfortably long hug from an overfamiliar stranger, or a double thumbs up from your manager on a team-building day, at the exact moment you decide you never want to join in. “Amaze” is the same, but has wider, more enthusiastic eyes, which it rolls very hard at you when you’re not looking. Sorry not sorry This is the battlecry of the wilfully unapologetic, who see themselves as edgy mavericks while they go about their daily business dropping truth bombs (being rude), taking no prisoners (being rude again) and making baristas’, waiters’ and shop assistants’ lives a misery because they’re too important to be polite. School night If you wear an itchy uniform, have chemistry in the morning and your alarm clock is a parent, then fine. If you’re kidulting through your 30s and don’t want to stay out for another drink, just say you’re tired: everybody else is, too. But also: live a little, go to work hungover. Again, everybody else is. Man crush This is alpha masculinity’s rare nod to homosexuality, which might come after watching a Ryan Gosling film, realising how cool he is and kind of wanting to be him and marry him all at the same time. Still, it’s better than “no homo”, I guess. Methinks Words you love are dying all over the place, yet this centuries-old signaller of faux-intelligence and an incoming garbage opinion prevails. Used by people who want to come across as clever, authoritative or interesting, but actually sound argumentative and pretentious. And old. “I’ve used this one for years,” Dent admits. Awkward. The Boy This sobriquet for the man of your dreams would be charming if he were the lead in a romantic novel. It tends to lose its lustre quite quickly when it becomes clear he’s a crashing, bumbling bore who can’t tuck his shirt into his pants, misses the bowl when he uses the loo, and forgets your birthday every other year. The trouble with The Boy is that he’s mythical. In reality, he’s all grown up; he’s just A Man. Banter The moth-eaten cape of respectability afforded to demeaning words, teasing, bullying or harassment. Banter is a secret handshake that permits you to say just about anything you want and nobody can get offended. Anyone who doesn’t fall into line is just being a buzzkill, mate – they’re not even worthy of your bantz. If banter had a face, you would never tire of punching it. Food baby Pain is pleasure’s natural pudding, and your eager forays into “nom nom” and #foodporn territory can result in only one thing: a food baby. Parents-to-be proudly pat their distended midriff like nobody ever ate before, but unless that burger is going to somehow pop out of you and demand both your attention and the entire contents of your bank account for the next 18 years (more like 40, who are we kidding?), then it’s not a baby, baby. I can’t even Pity the poor “I can’t even” crew – continually presented with situations that render them dumbstruck, able only to react with hands clamped to their face and a wide-eyed stare. Nothing trumps “I can’t even”; not “outraged”, “disgusted” or “horrified”. Once you can’t even, you can’t anything – you’re unmatchable. Sleeps “Just two more sleeps until my birthday,” Timmy says as you tuck the covers in tight. There’d be no problem were Timmy a freckly youngster in cartoon pyjamas. Timmy, however, is a middle manager in his 30s and, predictably, his birthday is set to last a whole week, because these things always do. But this isn’t just infantilisation, according to David Crystal, it’s a very old English usage, proving that basicness is one genetic trait we can’t breed out. Parentals The disturbingly cold trend for describing your mum and dad as a pair of androids isn’t actually as space age as you might think; this usage was recorded by the OED in the 16th century. “Mothership”, however, when talking about your dear old mum, is newer, but still unacceptable. If she knew you’d said that, she’d be bundling you into an escape pod and shooting you right out into space. All the feels Anger, joy, love, pain, misery, shock, excitement: they’re all present and correct, but in between the nerve endings and the mouth, or the typing fingers, they become a rush of something conveniently indefinable. “The feels” is almost an embarrassment, as if you can’t believe something is making you emotional, so you explain it away as “the feels” and hope it will pass. The feels can strike at any time: looking at a baby polar bear, mourning a dead relative or reading about Aleppo – as long as you’ve got your feels handy, there’s no need to, well, say how you actually feel. On the internet, the fact you’re feeling something is usually enough. #blessed “I want the good things in my life to look like a happy accident and I also have an overwhelming desire for you to envy me. If we were next-door neighbours, I’d own everything you do, only one price point up.” Hubby Most husbands have names – John, Dave, Benoît, even – but if someone really wants you to know they have one, that dude will be known only as “Hubby”. It’s used by those recently wed and bizarrely anxious to show they’re settled and sorted. First recorded in 1600, in 2017 “Hubby” is wrapped in “I have one, you don’t” smugness, a fast-forward to the kind of cosy resentment only 20 years of marriage can bring you. Listen carefully, and you can almost hear Hubby’s slippers shuffling towards you – even though he’s only 29. Lit “Pretentious maybe, but quite poetic,” Susie Dent says, “and another move on for lit and its meaning of drunk or high.” Yep, it’s brilliantly expressive when used by cool teens describing the illegal rave they’re at, and definitely works when you’re talking about Beyoncé’s post-Grammys party packed with A-listers. But your dreary barbecue or gathering of thirtysomethings in a conservatory with a leaky roof? Lit it most certainly is not. Bring accelerant. Cheeky Struggling very hard to come out the other side of a huge identity crisis in recent years, is the adjective “cheeky”. It belongs to impudent young rapscallions in the playground, buttocks, Carry On movies. It should not be a conspiratorial wink while you enjoy a gin and tonic, a holiday, a trip to the shops, getting up to something illegal in a cubicle or eating some bloody chicken. Goals Envy masquerading as ambition can be quite the driver when it comes to careers, travel or even a “squad” – a bunch of celebrity mates you covet. But when your “goals” relate to a stranger’s bacon sandwich, it might be time to think bigger. Going to the supermarket is not “grocery goals”. Come on. • Justin Myers blogs as theguyliner.com",2017-01-20T12:00:06Z,News
