But none of them have much to do with books.</p> <p>In fact, one suspects, he has no appetite for books – apart from his own biography, The Art of the Deal, which he frequently plugs as his favourite reading, alongside the Bible.</p> <p>It is one of many ways in which he contrasts with his predecessor Barack Obama, who this week gave <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/obamas-secret-to-surviving-the-white-house-years-books.html?_r=0"">an interview to the New York Times</a> in which he revealed the debt he owes to reading. Not only had it helped him “slow down and get perspective”, he said, it also helped him “get inside somebody else’s shoes”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/14/liu-cixin-chinese-sci-fi-universal-the-three-body-problem"">'People hope my book will be China's Star Wars': Liu Cixin on China's exploding sci-fi scene</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obama cites literary influences that range from Shakespeare to Nelson Mandela through to Chinese author Liu Cixin’s post-apocalyptic The Three-Body Problem. “My day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty,” he said, in comparison with invasion by aliens. Perspective is everything.</p> <p>How some of us will miss that man. Because, on the evidence available, the incoming resident of the White House looks to be the least well-read president of modern times.</p> <p>In fact, it is not even certain that Trump has read The Art of the Deal. Certainly, his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz had doubts. <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all"">Last year he told the New Yorker</a>: “I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.”</p> <p>I suspect Schwartz may be on to something. Only once before has Trump named an alternative to the Bible or his own memoir: the 1929 classic All Quiet on the Western Front, which he picked as a favourite while speaking to Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly last May.</p> <p>But even then, he managed to spoil the effect, when asked what was the most recent book he had read, by adding: “I read passages, I read areas, I’ll read chapters – I don’t have the time.”</p> <p>Even George W Bush, who for a long time assured us that Eric Carle’s The Very Hungry Caterpillar <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/22/booksforchildrenandteenagers"">was his favourite book,</a> turned out to be a closet reader of rapacious appetite. His Hicksville cover was blown when one of his closest advisers, Karl Rove, revealed in the Wall Street Journal that <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123025595706634689"">the two were locked in a reading duel</a> that meant the ex-president devoured on average two books a week, ranging from the predictable political biographies to unlikely ventures into classic fiction, such as Albert Camus’ archetypal novel of alienation The Outsider. I presume he read that after the Iraq war.</p> <p>Elsewhere around the globe, political leaders have shared their taste for literature, making Trump’s bookshelves look all the more bare. If he wants to heat up the bromance with Vladimir Putin, the new leader of the free world could do no better than to dip into the many books that have inspired the Russian leader.</p> <p>Perhaps it would be too big an ask to start with Christian existentialist Nikolai Berdyaev’s The Philosophy of Inequality – <a href=""http://www.interpretermag.com/vladimir-putin-set-his-sights-on-conservatism/"">which Trump’s Kremlin counterpart distributed to regional governors as required reading</a>. Ivan Turgenev’s A Sportsman’s Sketches might be better; this collection of stories, revealing the suffering of the peasantry in the Russian countryside, would make an imaginative escape should Trump develop an interest in life beyond the gilded rooms of Trump Tower.</p> <p>I fear Angela Merkel’s favourite title, Goethe’s Faust, would make him a tad uneasy – though it might provide some insight into how he and the German chancellor could start over when they meet later this year. <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576329081052390122"">Speaking to the Wall Street Journal</a>, Merkel said Faust “gives you an idea of why we Germans want to get to the bottom of things”.</p> <p>I don’t want to alarm the president-elect but the German leader shares her choice with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according <a href=""http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-10/18/content_27093635_2.htm"">to The China Daily</a>. Could this hint at a new alliance?</p> <p>Maybe it’s time for the incoming president to seek literary solace in the special relationship and look to the UK leaders’s recommended reading lists.</p> <p>There is plenty there for the commander-in-chief to while away his hours on Air Force One, though somehow I don’t see Jeremy Corbyn’s <a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/londoners-diary-corbyn-and-his-curious-bond-with-joyce-a3349271.html"">pick of James Joyce’s Ulysses</a> (read three times) doing it for the Donald.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/06/jonathan-coe-will-satire-save-us-in-the-age-of-donald-trump"">Jonathan Coe: will satire save us in the age of Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is UK prime minister Theresa May’s opportunity to get up close and personal with her US counterpart. Her preference is for detective novels. Perfect: nothing too heavy and a bit of page-turning escape when deciding whether to use the nuclear codes or not.</p> <p>That said, if I were May, I’d keep stumm about her favourite read: Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.

But none of them have much to do with books. In fact, one suspects, he has no appetite for books – apart from his own biography, The Art of the Deal, which he frequently plugs as his favourite reading, alongside the Bible. It is one of many ways in which he contrasts with his predecessor Barack Obama, who this week gave an interview to the New York Times in which he revealed the debt he owes to reading. Not only had it helped him “slow down and get perspective”, he said, it also helped him “get inside somebody else’s shoes”. Obama cites literary influences that range from Shakespeare to Nelson Mandela through to Chinese author Liu Cixin’s post-apocalyptic The Three-Body Problem. “My day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty,” he said, in comparison with invasion by aliens. Perspective is everything. How some of us will miss that man. Because, on the evidence available, the incoming resident of the White House looks to be the least well-read president of modern times. In fact, it is not even certain that Trump has read The Art of the Deal. Certainly, his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz had doubts. Last year he told the New Yorker: “I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.” I suspect Schwartz may be on to something. Only once before has Trump named an alternative to the Bible or his own memoir: the 1929 classic All Quiet on the Western Front, which he picked as a favourite while speaking to Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly last May. But even then, he managed to spoil the effect, when asked what was the most recent book he had read, by adding: “I read passages, I read areas, I’ll read chapters – I don’t have the time.” Even George W Bush, who for a long time assured us that Eric Carle’s The Very Hungry Caterpillar was his favourite book, turned out to be a closet reader of rapacious appetite. His Hicksville cover was blown when one of his closest advisers, Karl Rove, revealed in the Wall Street Journal that the two were locked in a reading duel that meant the ex-president devoured on average two books a week, ranging from the predictable political biographies to unlikely ventures into classic fiction, such as Albert Camus’ archetypal novel of alienation The Outsider. I presume he read that after the Iraq war. Elsewhere around the globe, political leaders have shared their taste for literature, making Trump’s bookshelves look all the more bare. If he wants to heat up the bromance with Vladimir Putin, the new leader of the free world could do no better than to dip into the many books that have inspired the Russian leader. Perhaps it would be too big an ask to start with Christian existentialist Nikolai Berdyaev’s The Philosophy of Inequality – which Trump’s Kremlin counterpart distributed to regional governors as required reading. Ivan Turgenev’s A Sportsman’s Sketches might be better; this collection of stories, revealing the suffering of the peasantry in the Russian countryside, would make an imaginative escape should Trump develop an interest in life beyond the gilded rooms of Trump Tower. I fear Angela Merkel’s favourite title, Goethe’s Faust, would make him a tad uneasy – though it might provide some insight into how he and the German chancellor could start over when they meet later this year. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Merkel said Faust “gives you an idea of why we Germans want to get to the bottom of things”. I don’t want to alarm the president-elect but the German leader shares her choice with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to The China Daily. Could this hint at a new alliance? Maybe it’s time for the incoming president to seek literary solace in the special relationship and look to the UK leaders’s recommended reading lists. There is plenty there for the commander-in-chief to while away his hours on Air Force One, though somehow I don’t see Jeremy Corbyn’s pick of James Joyce’s Ulysses (read three times) doing it for the Donald. Perhaps this is UK prime minister Theresa May’s opportunity to get up close and personal with her US counterpart. Her preference is for detective novels. Perfect: nothing too heavy and a bit of page-turning escape when deciding whether to use the nuclear codes or not. That said, if I were May, I’d keep stumm about her favourite read: Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. Somehow I can’t see a novel about a feisty heroine unimpressed by a rich man who thinks he’s God’s gift being a big turn on for the new president. A recommended reading list for Trump Third Empire: The Russia That Should by Mikhail Yuriev. A favourite novel of Trump’s new BFF, Vladimir Putin. It’s easy to see why as there are close parallels between the Russian leader and the hero this 2006 sci-fi novel – the shadowy but heroic leader “Vladimir the Restorer”, who, aided by the Ukrainian people, makes Russia a great Empire again. One Billion Customers by James McGregor. The man who built up the Dow Jones’s operation in China can offer the former star of The Apprentice useful tips on how to deal with the world’s biggest markets. No dry textbook, McGregor’s book provides insights into China that are witty, informed and might just prevent the new leader sparking a catastrophic trade war. When the Facts Change by Tony Judt. Historian Judt knew what it was to change his mind – particularly to move from the extremes of Marxist Zionism in his youth to a commitment to social democracy. Not only will Judt’s essays help the new president to better understand Israel and Palestine, they may help him realise that it is possible to change your mind gracefully. Language, Truth and Logic by AJ Ayer. With all those speeches he will have to make, this 1936 classic on thought and communication is a must-read for the Donald. Offering advice on fuzzy logic and muddled speaking, it is a useful primer for the “fake news” age. It even has tests, with which the president-elect can evaluate his tweets for statements of unverifiable “fact”. No Means No! by Jayneen Sanders. It may be too late for the pussygrabber-in-chief, but this picture book for three-to-nine-year-olds might help him begin to appreciate personal boundaries.

Even George W Bush, elected after the extraordinary recount and legal coup in 2000, earned a 61% rating for his transition.</p> <p>These aren’t trivial numbers. They are the white blood cells of the circulatory system that flows through Washington. Good poll numbers can inoculate a president when Congress opposes him. Bad numbers reveal a president vulnerable to outside attacks and embolden his many rivals both inside and outside his own party.</p> <p>Those numbers are about to get a lot worse. In his first year in office, Obama lost more than 15 points on his job approval. If Trump follows the same track, he will be polling in the mid-20s by this time next year. To put that into context, Richard Nixon’s job approval on the day he quit the Oval Office was 24%.</p> <p>And no Mr President, these aren’t <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/821344302651555840"">rigged polls</a>.</p> <p>The polls just reflect what people think of you, and they all rate you poorly both on a personal and professional basis. Here’s what’s rigged: an election you can win after losing the popular vote by more than 2 points, as the polls correctly forecast.</p> <p>What could drive Trump’s poll numbers so low? Unlike Obama, who inherited the worst economy in two generations, the incoming president cannot blame external forces. The greatest threat, both to his presidency and the republic, comes from Trump himself.</p> <p>Somewhere near the top of the list is potential profiteering from the presidency through his continued ownership of the Trump Organization. It seems Trump will be <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/15/trump-needs-to-give-up-his-trump-hotel-lease-right-now/?utm_term=.4629e1d61cd3"">in breach</a> of the government lease on his new Washington hotel as soon as he is sworn into office today. His efforts to hold onto the lease – which specifically prohibits government officials from holding it – will reveal his true priorities in office.</p> <p>According to his personal attorney, Trump has drawn an ethical line by appointing his own ethics officer inside his own company. This is a quaint arrangement favored by foxes guarding henhouses. The ethics of the Trump Organization are irrelevant; the ethics of the presidency, however, are governed by article one of the constitution, which prohibits gifts of any kind from foreign powers.</p> <p>Even under his own sham scheme, the new president has already breached his so-called ethical standards. “President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated,” Trump’s attorney Sheri Dillon told the press last week. “The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency.”</p> <p>This will come as news to the good people of Aberdeen who are about to witness the dramatic expansion of the Trump golf course in Scotland. That <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/14/trump-scotland-golf-resort-conflicts-of-interest"">expansion</a>, confirmed just this week, involves another 18 holes, a new 450-room hotel, a timeshare complex and a private housing estate.</p> <p>Trump’s staff brush aside these niceties by saying the Scottish deal is just a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJZPzQESq_0"">wafer-thin mint</a> of an expansion of an existing deal.</p> <p>Sadly the constitution doesn’t distinguish between new and existing deals when it strictly prohibits the president from drawing any benefits from foreign powers. It just says they are all unconstitutional.</p> <p>What kind of deals might breach the now famous emoluments clause? As <a href=""https://projects.propublica.org/trump-conflicts/"">ProPublica has detailed</a>, there’s the Indian deal in Mumbai that involves the vice-president of the ruling BJP party, who is also an elected official. There’s a deal in Bali, Indonesia, with an Indonesian politician, who has partnered with state-owned companies from China and South Korea. And there’s a deal in Manila with a man recently named as an economic envoy to the US by the murderous President Duterte of the Philippines.</p> <p>You don’t have to be a constitutional law professor to appreciate the legal and political jeopardy for Trump. President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about sex, a supposedly high crime and misdemeanor that is not actually cited by the constitution. Unlike making money from foreign officials, which is.</p> <p>Finally there’s the noose that’s tightening around Trump’s alleged Russian relationships. You know, the ones the new president said IN ALL CAPS <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/819159806489591809"">absolutely don’t exist</a> and never have, not ever, oh no.</p> <p>The FBI and five other agencies are now <a href=""http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article127231799.html  "">investigating</a> whether Russia covertly transferred cash to pay email hackers in the United States as part of a broader Kremlin plot to influence the presidential campaign in Trump’s favor.</p> <p>We also <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region"">know</a> that counter-intelligence officials are investigating possible contacts and ties between Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian officials.</p> <p>Almost every scandal gets compared to Watergate, but very few genuinely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course, Watergate wasn’t potentially financed by our mortal enemies in Moscow, even if it did involve undermining a presidential election.</p> <p>The last covert plot between a president’s inner circle and an enemy state was Reagan’s illegal gun-running operation to Iran. Perhaps that’s what Trump means by stealing Reagan’s slogan about making America great again.</p> <p>Now that he’s the 45th President of the United States, the rules of this game have officially changed. Donald Trump cannot trash tweet his way out his problems any more. The constitution does not provide for that particular <a href=""http://www.iloveairforceone.com/movie/escape-pod/"">escape pod</a> from Air Force One.</p> <p>The TV star is now the desperately flawed lead in a tragicomedy, the author of his own misfortunes.

It isn’t wishful thinking to begin the countdown to Trump’s self-destruction on his inauguration day. It’s merely a statement of the facts of presidential life: this is no longer a game played out on TV and Twitter. Everything changes when The Apprentice star takes the oath of office on that stage outside the Capitol. Legally, politically and diplomatically, Trump’s world is utterly transformed. What passed before as media outrage now has a measurable impact on his presidential polls and by extension his presidential power. What passed before as a sycophantic discussion with his own attorney now opens the door to endless litigation and the clear and present danger of impeachment. What passed before as a curious cozying up to Vladimir Putin is now transformed into a multi-agency investigation into illegal foreign payments to undermine the election. We should not confuse populism with popularity. Trump enters the Oval Office as the weakest new commander-in-chief in living memory. Having lost the popular vote by almost 3 million, he has no political mandate to speak of. And his disastrous poll numbers are hard to overstate. This is the high-water mark of every president’s approval ratings – before they do the tough stuff of governing and encounter one of the many fast-moving crises that pass through the West Wing.

Approval of his transition shows him trailing Obama by an even greater margin: just 40% like the way Trump has performed since November, compared to 84% for Obama’s transition eight years ago. Even George W Bush, elected after the extraordinary recount and legal coup in 2000, earned a 61% rating for his transition. These aren’t trivial numbers. They are the white blood cells of the circulatory system that flows through Washington. Good poll numbers can inoculate a president when Congress opposes him. Bad numbers reveal a president vulnerable to outside attacks and embolden his many rivals both inside and outside his own party. Those numbers are about to get a lot worse. In his first year in office, Obama lost more than 15 points on his job approval. If Trump follows the same track, he will be polling in the mid-20s by this time next year. To put that into context, Richard Nixon’s job approval on the day he quit the Oval Office was 24%. And no Mr President, these aren’t rigged polls. The polls just reflect what people think of you, and they all rate you poorly both on a personal and professional basis. Here’s what’s rigged: an election you can win after losing the popular vote by more than 2 points, as the polls correctly forecast. What could drive Trump’s poll numbers so low? Unlike Obama, who inherited the worst economy in two generations, the incoming president cannot blame external forces. The greatest threat, both to his presidency and the republic, comes from Trump himself. Somewhere near the top of the list is potential profiteering from the presidency through his continued ownership of the Trump Organization. It seems Trump will be in breach of the government lease on his new Washington hotel as soon as he is sworn into office today. His efforts to hold onto the lease – which specifically prohibits government officials from holding it – will reveal his true priorities in office. According to his personal attorney, Trump has drawn an ethical line by appointing his own ethics officer inside his own company. This is a quaint arrangement favored by foxes guarding henhouses. The ethics of the Trump Organization are irrelevant; the ethics of the presidency, however, are governed by article one of the constitution, which prohibits gifts of any kind from foreign powers. Even under his own sham scheme, the new president has already breached his so-called ethical standards. “President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated,” Trump’s attorney Sheri Dillon told the press last week. “The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency.” This will come as news to the good people of Aberdeen who are about to witness the dramatic expansion of the Trump golf course in Scotland. That expansion, confirmed just this week, involves another 18 holes, a new 450-room hotel, a timeshare complex and a private housing estate. Trump’s staff brush aside these niceties by saying the Scottish deal is just a wafer-thin mint of an expansion of an existing deal. Sadly the constitution doesn’t distinguish between new and existing deals when it strictly prohibits the president from drawing any benefits from foreign powers. It just says they are all unconstitutional. What kind of deals might breach the now famous emoluments clause? As ProPublica has detailed, there’s the Indian deal in Mumbai that involves the vice-president of the ruling BJP party, who is also an elected official. There’s a deal in Bali, Indonesia, with an Indonesian politician, who has partnered with state-owned companies from China and South Korea. And there’s a deal in Manila with a man recently named as an economic envoy to the US by the murderous President Duterte of the Philippines. You don’t have to be a constitutional law professor to appreciate the legal and political jeopardy for Trump. President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about sex, a supposedly high crime and misdemeanor that is not actually cited by the constitution. Unlike making money from foreign officials, which is. Finally there’s the noose that’s tightening around Trump’s alleged Russian relationships. You know, the ones the new president said IN ALL CAPS absolutely don’t exist and never have, not ever, oh no. The FBI and five other agencies are now investigating whether Russia covertly transferred cash to pay email hackers in the United States as part of a broader Kremlin plot to influence the presidential campaign in Trump’s favor. We also know that counter-intelligence officials are investigating possible contacts and ties between Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian officials. Almost every scandal gets compared to Watergate, but very few genuinely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course, Watergate wasn’t potentially financed by our mortal enemies in Moscow, even if it did involve undermining a presidential election. The last covert plot between a president’s inner circle and an enemy state was Reagan’s illegal gun-running operation to Iran. Perhaps that’s what Trump means by stealing Reagan’s slogan about making America great again. Now that he’s the 45th President of the United States, the rules of this game have officially changed. Donald Trump cannot trash tweet his way out his problems any more. The constitution does not provide for that particular escape pod from Air Force One. The TV star is now the desperately flawed lead in a tragicomedy, the author of his own misfortunes. If our bodies are our gardens, this president has unnaturally orange thumbs.",7493,Richard Wolffe,NA,NA,NA,"<a href=""profile/richard-wolffe"">Richard Wolffe</a>",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among the reactions: “Europe’s nightmare” (Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung); “Trump ruins the European Union” (Poland’s Gazeta Wyborcza); and “Europe could be the first victim of Trump” (commentator in Italy’s Corriere della Sera). But Kai Diekman, Bild’s publisher, said: “Trump has been the biggest political experiment since the end of the cold war. Trump says things which are actually unthinkable in diplomacy. He is rude, he is insulting – and he is painfully honest. This can lead to conflicts, but also break open crusted conflicts.” And some pro-Russian media in eastern European countries showed sympathy for Trump acting as a strong man in the White House. European media were virtually unanimous in their assessment that an alliance between Trump and Putin will have harmful consequences for Europe. Portugal’s Público commented: “If Trump succeeds in accomplishing his Russian policy, the first ‘casualty’ will be Europe. It will be marginalised. It will drift apart.” Not surprisingly, Trump’s potential rapprochement with Russia particularly alarmed news media in central and eastern Europe. Latvia’s Latvijas Avize said a “deal with Putin won’t bring peace (…) it makes war even likelier.” Despite striking similarities in the negative (or, at best, neutral) tone of the media coverage, some news outlets expressed cautious optimism that a Trump presidency might actually yield positive outcomes, especially for the economy. According to some analyses in Austrian newspapers, stock markets might react favourably to Trump’s promises of reducing taxes and curbing the bureaucracy. And some German commentators expressed hopes for Trump’s deal-making skills. Surprisingly, says the EJO study, few papers focused on the potential implications of a Trump presidency on their own nation’s outlook. Domestic issues, such as the rise of right-wing populism and similarities between Europe and the US about a general disillusionment with political elites, received little coverage over the seven days. Among those commentators who did highlight potential connections, was the biggest Czech daily Mladá fronta Dnes. It said: “After the victory of Brexit supporters and Donald Trump, it seems as anything can happen in the West. “In this context, the scenario of Marine Le Pen winning the [2017] presidential election and a subsequent French referendum on leaving the European Union does not look like a figment of a lunatic.” Source, plus detailed report, including reaction by three US papers to Trump’s statements on Europe: EJO",4016,Roy Greenslade,2017-01-23T12:45:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/roygreenslade"">Roy Greenslade</a>",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The next morning, remembering the night before while driving her car, the 24-year-old felt jubilant to be living in Trump’s America. </p> <p>The two women made matching Trump caps – blue and black – decorated with sequins and the slogan “Adorable Deplorable” in honor of the inauguration.

It was a term, some argued, that liberals just threw around whenever they were losing an argument. </p> <p>A local bakery in Pennsylvania had just produced tiny hat-shaped “Make America Great Again” cakes in honor of the inauguration, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Traubs-Bakery-200536436628076/"">a short post </a>about the themed cakes on Facebook had sparked a long debate, with some commenters labelling the bakery racist, or saying they would not longer patronize it. “Why not a “grab ’em by the p*ssy” cake?” one commenter asked. Or a “deport all immigrants cake”?</p>    <p>The bus supporters were indignant. They had won. It was supposed to be a day to celebrate. And yet the news was full of protests and threatened disruption, and even a bakery making an inauguration dessert had somehow become divisive. </p> <p>“A cake can’t be racist,” Dave DeFries, a longtime Trump supporter from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, said in exasperation. </p> <p>In the seat behind Brandi and Steph, Laura Ann, 34, who asked that her last name not be used, had bought two of them. She sliced them and handed them out. The cake was moist, the frosting tasting faintly of marshmallow. </p> <p>Laura Ann had voted for Obama twice. She worked in healthcare, and had wanted the president to fix the health insurance system. He had failed. She was still kicking herself for voting for him. As a gun owner with several AR-15 rifles – she found them light and easy to handle as a female shooter – she had also been frustrated by the constant attacks on “the so-called ‘assault rifle’”.</p> <p>“I’d really like to see [Trump] help the inner cities more,” she said. She thought Ben Carson, who grew up in Detroit and went on to become a surgeon, would be a great force in helping urban America. </p> <p>Eileen, at 46, had cast her first ballot ever for Trump. “I want the jobs to come back to America,” she said. Her brother, a systems analyst, had lost his job to workers in India and had been forced to personally train the Indian worker who was taking his place, under threat of losing his pension. </p> <p>Eileen also felt Obama had failed to bring insurance companies in line to bring healthcare costs down. Worried that her high school friends who voted for Clinton would attack her, she asked not to publish her last name. </p> <p>Many of the supporters said they had never been politically involved before Trump ran for president. Several had voted for Obama at least once. Some of the new activists said they were amazed by the energy of Trump’s movement. “It doesn’t seem like a political environment,” Dave Ennis said. “It seems like we’re going to a football game.”</p> <p>Some said that their friends or family were worried that something might happen on inauguration day, that the protests might make DC dangerous. One man mentioned that he had seen a video produced by the conservative provocateur James O’Keefe about activists discussing a plan to throw acid on Trump supporters. </p> <h2>‘It’s like, I get it, I get it, slavery was bad. I didn’t do it’</h2> <p>At the back of the bus, another Dave (who did not give his last name) sat opposite his wife and 16 year-old son, Brian, who he called a liberal “snowflake”. The two of them argued constantly, the father said, especially about Black Lives Matter. </p> <p>Brian said he believed that the Black Lives Matter protesters and the Boston Tea Party rebels were identical – except for their race. Protesters had to be loud to make themselves noticed. His father was more skeptical that black Americans were being unfairly victimized. His own interactions with the police when he was younger had taught him that when people chose a certain lifestyle, the police would target them – and there was nothing wrong with that.</p>    <p>Brandi and Steph said that felt that racism toward black Americans had been given a disproportionate platform compared with other kinds of racism. They disapproved of Obama supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, which they saw as racist. </p> <p>“Why is it Black Lives Matter, not all lives?” Stephanie asked.</p> <p>“I just don’t think most cops are out to get black people,” Brandi replied. </p> <p>“The media blows a lot of this out of proportion,” Stephanie said. </p> <p>“I didn’t think it’s bad that we had a first black president. That’s not bad. That’s great,” Brandi opined. But Obama “should not have been elected to a second term. I think his color had a lot to do with that.” </p> <p>In school, Brandi said, some black girls had bullied her, and when she complained, “my teacher told me to grow a thicker skin”.</p> <p>Asked about the systemic inequality black Americans face – in the criminal justice system, or in education – Brandi said that, because she’s been living in Delaware, a relatively liberal state, “maybe I haven’t seen that as much”.</p> <p>“I, like, see the opposite.

Stephanie didn’t believe for a long time that Trump could really pull off a presidential demeanor. That’s why she thought Clinton would win. Brandi said she did not believe new environmental protections should be rolled back, and her stepmother had serious concerns about Trump’s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and school choice advocate whose understanding of basic educational concepts and laws came under question during her <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/betsy-devos-confirmation-hearing-live-key-points"">confirmation hearing</a>. “I know teachers aren’t very happy about that,” she said.<br></p>    <p>“I’m a little bit worried about the tweeting,” Brandi added.

Brandi, who was waitressing as she went through college, said: “I’d like to see more money. I’d like to see more tips.”</p> <p>Neither of the friends had been concerned about his comments about grabbing women by the pussy. “That was 10 years ago, and people change,” Brandi said.</p> <p>Brandi said if a famous billionaire had tried to grope her, she would have sued immediately, not stayed silent for years until the man ran for president. “Damn straight, if someone gropes me, I would want to sue,” she said.

Trump, after all, was just the president. </p> <p>“He’s not God. He’s not Hitler.

Stephanie Friess and Brandi Tillman have been friends since high school, and now they were on their way from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington to celebrate the man who had given them a brand new country. On election night, Steph stayed up past 3am to see Trump’s victory being announced. The next morning, remembering the night before while driving her car, the 24-year-old felt jubilant to be living in Trump’s America. The two women made matching Trump caps – blue and black – decorated with sequins and the slogan “Adorable Deplorable” in honor of the inauguration. Hillary Clinton had tried to attack Trump for lifting up the most “deplorable” among his followers: “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it”. Trump’s followers had proudly reclaimed the term, and now Brandi and Steph bedazzled it. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women will be marching in Washington in protest of Trump’s presidency in a demonstration called the Women’s March. While large majorities of black and Latina women voted against Trump and for Hillary Clinton, white women didn’t. Brandi and Steph are part of the majority: early exit polls showed that 53% of white women voted for Trump, including 45% of women with college degrees. The two women, both college students, were not entirely convinced by Donald Trump at first. But, Steph said, “he definitely grows on you”.

If this turns out to be more than a passing trend, it will make for an interesting general election in 2020. Most commentators have focused their attention on the Labour heartlands in the north that voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU and would be vulnerable to a strong Brexit Conservative or Ukip candidate.

Friday “The senator [later President Windrip] was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his ‘ideas’ almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a travelling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humour the sly cynicism of a country store. Aside from his dramatic glory, Buzz Windrip was a Professional Common Man. Oh, he was common enough. He had every prejudice and aspiration of every American Common Man. He believed in the desirability and therefore the sanctity of thick buckwheat cakes with adulterated maple syrup, and the superiority of anyone who possessed a million dollars. He regarded spats, walking sticks, caviar, titles, tea-drinking, poetry not daily syndicated in newspapers and all foreigners, possibly excepting the British, as degenerate.” Not a modern commentary on Donald Trump, but an extract from the 1935 novel It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis which has just been republished by Penguin.

But there were cheers <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/trump-supporters-inauguration-national-mall"">from Trump’s supporters</a> on a rainy National Mall in Washington. The crowd was largely white and notably smaller than for many past inaugurations.</p> <p>Under the dome of the US Capitol, the billionaire businessman hailed the “historic movement” that swept him to a shock victory over Hillary Clinton in last November’s presidential election, claiming it was unique in world history. Citizens expect great education, safe neighbourhoods and good jobs, the 70-year-old continued.</p> <p>“But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential.<br></p> <p>“This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.”</p> <p>It was a grim account of the most prosperous nation on earth from a man denounced by critics as an authoritarian populist. Trump’s aides had indicated that one of his inspirations for the speech was John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961. But there were closer echoes of a 1968 speech by Richard Nixon that described “cities enveloped in smoke and flame” and hearing “millions of Americans cry out in anguish”.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/20/reaction-to-donald-trump-speech"">'He has already let America down': the reaction to Trump's first speech as president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As America’s political elite looked on, Trump went on to blame past US governments for favouring other nations at the American people’s own expense, from the military to infrastructure to factories. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” he said.</p> <p>“But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first.”<br></p> <p>For some, the phrase “America first” has disquieting associations with a 1940s movement that aimed to keep America out of the second world war and came to be accused of antisemitism.

Moments after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, Trump described a country in crisis and pledged an isolationist and protectionist cure, declaring: “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.” Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton looked stone-faced during the speech, while George W Bush at times appeared uncomfortable. But there were cheers from Trump’s supporters on a rainy National Mall in Washington. The crowd was largely white and notably smaller than for many past inaugurations. Under the dome of the US Capitol, the billionaire businessman hailed the “historic movement” that swept him to a shock victory over Hillary Clinton in last November’s presidential election, claiming it was unique in world history. Citizens expect great education, safe neighbourhoods and good jobs, the 70-year-old continued. “But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealised potential. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” It was a grim account of the most prosperous nation on earth from a man denounced by critics as an authoritarian populist. Trump’s aides had indicated that one of his inspirations for the speech was John F Kennedy’s inaugural address in 1961. But there were closer echoes of a 1968 speech by Richard Nixon that described “cities enveloped in smoke and flame” and hearing “millions of Americans cry out in anguish”. As America’s political elite looked on, Trump went on to blame past US governments for favouring other nations at the American people’s own expense, from the military to infrastructure to factories. “We’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own,” he said. “But that is the past. And now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first.” For some, the phrase “America first” has disquieting associations with a 1940s movement that aimed to keep America out of the second world war and came to be accused of antisemitism. But on Friday the crowd, many wearing “make America great again” baseball caps and other regalia, applauded and cheered. Trump continued: “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.” Breaking with Republican orthodoxy, Trump promised a massive infrastructure building programme including roads, bridges, airports and tunnels, potentially creating thousands of jobs and costing billions of dollars. “We will follow two simple rules; buy American and hire American.” Trump’s longshot candidacy has proved uniquely divisive ever since he launched it in June 2015 by denouncing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists.

Look at the Democrats boycotting it. He can’t get one day of grace. That’s a little frustrating, I think.” Nearly a million people are expected on the National Mall in Washington for a ceremonial transfer of power that will observe time-honoured traditions and pageantry but usher in profound political uncertainties. Trump has promised to shake up the postwar liberal order, issued contradictory policy statements and, even before taking office, sparked anger in foreign capitals with his volatile approach. Questions have been raised over the character and temperament of a man who boasted about groping women and still picks fights on Twitter. Protests are expected on Friday, and a huge women’s march is planned for Saturday, as liberals dig in for four years of opposition to Trump, who enters office as the most unpopular of at least the past seven presidents at the beginning of their terms, according to opinion polls. He also takes power under the shadow of Russia’s alleged meddling in the presidential election, which has led some Democrats to question his legitimacy. Up to 60 members of Congress will boycott the inauguration ceremony at the US Capitol. At least 28,000 security personnel from 36 state, local and federal agencies will be deployed for inauguration events, reportedly costing $200m, divided between taxpayers and private donors. Parts of the capital are on lockdown, with steel barriers erected on normally busy streets, to head off disruptive protests. Trump and his wife, Melania, will on Friday morning go to the White House for tea with Obama and his wife, Michelle, even as house movers work upstairs to swap their private possessions. The inauguration ceremony will begin with performances by the Talladega Marching Tornadoes, the Rockettes dance troupe, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old singer Jackie Evancho. At noon, in a scene not so long ago unthinkable to the political establishment, Trump will take the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts. He will place his hand on his own Bible – a gift from his mother in 1955 – as well as a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration. In an operatic tableau, standing nearby will be Hillary Clinton, the candidate Trump threatened to jail during the campaign. She received 2.9 million more votes than he did last November but lost the electoral college. Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Jimmy Carter will also be present. Trump will become the first US president in the 240-year-old republic who has never served in the military or held public office. At 70 he will also be the oldest in his first term, eclipsing Ronald Reagan’s record. Barrack said Trump’s inaugural speech would focus on “the issues that unite us” and claimed that the divisions from the campaign would “vanish”. “What you’ll hear in his address is a switch from candidate to president,” he told the CBS This Morning show.",9410,David Smith in Washington,NA,NA,NA,"<a href=""profile/davidsmith"">David Smith</a> in Washington",1,2017-01-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is why.</p> <p>Right now the biggest challenge facing American activism is not the size of our protests or the volume of our dissent. Instead, what is holding us back from winning is that even if, by some stroke of divine luck, our protests were to topple Trump, we have no movement capable of taking power and governing after his fall.</p> <p>Our leaderless social movements remain incapable of making complex decisions together. We can raise awareness but we are still unable to win elections. American activism is lagging behind our comrades in Europe who have built powerful electoral movements such as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/26/spain-podemos-syriza-victory-greek-elections"">Spain’s Podemos</a>, Italy’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement"">Five Star Movement</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/12/polls-suggests-icelands-pirate-party-form-next-government"">Iceland’s Pirate party</a>. Until protesters in America are backed by a credible movement that can win elections and govern effectively, our street protests will remain a performative temper tantrum, at best.</p> <p>How to win elections and govern is the essential challenge that every genuine activist must now turn to solving. In the weeks and months ahead, I’ll continue the revolutionary experiments that I’ve begun in my tiny town in rural Oregon. I’m confident that if the collective creativity of American activism is oriented toward replicating the successes of electoral movements abroad then we can pull it off bigger than anyone else.</p> <p>So when people ask me if I’m joining the Women’s March in my community this weekend, or if I’ll be flying to DC to be raucous with my movement buddies during the inauguration, I tell them the truth: I’m staying here and preparing for the day after the march, when the protesters return home and are ready to get serious about building a social movement that uses protest to sweep the midterm elections in 2018. I’ll be waiting for you.</p> <h2><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mary-jane-wells"">Mary Jane Wells</a>: An inauguration ball gives me a platform to highlight sexual consent</h2>    <p>I am a British-born actress and writer whose recent work revolves around sexual trauma.

The horror that I felt when Donald Trump was elected has not subsided. I still cannot believe that a man who has shown such contempt for women, disabled people and people of colour could become the most powerful person in the world. I’m marching because my brother, the man whom I helped to raise and the person on this planet whom I love the most, is severely autistic. When I was at school, kids on the bus used to imitate the noises and the gestures that he made. Now the sort of school bully that I thought I had left behind will be president of the US. And just as I fought them, I will fight this. I’m marching because I don’t want to be alone when that happens. I feel a profound need to be with other people, particularly other women, who believe in equality, justice and human rights. And because the thought of dumbly watching without making my displeasure felt is too depressing for words. I want to stand in solidarity with women in America whose reproductive rights will undoubtedly come under attack. I want them to know that we are out there, thinking of them, and fighting for them. I’m marching because a man who is much, much more stupid than Hillary Clinton and millions of other women, has been granted the power he has, partly because of his gender and despite his designs on women’s rights. And I want the daughter I hope one day to have to know that I was not OK with that. That I am not OK with the continued abuse, harassment, violence and discrimination suffered by women. That I am not OK with this man’s indifference to climate change, and his views on race and incompetence. That I am not OK with the fact that the elite are already gradually normalising him. This situation is far from normal. It is distressing, and embarrassing, and terrifying, and I can’t just do nothing. That’s why I’m marching. Micah White: I’m preparing for the day after the march when we need to get serious about building a social movement I’ve been an activist all my life, but I am not joining the mass marches against Trump this weekend. This is why. Right now the biggest challenge facing American activism is not the size of our protests or the volume of our dissent. Instead, what is holding us back from winning is that even if, by some stroke of divine luck, our protests were to topple Trump, we have no movement capable of taking power and governing after his fall. Our leaderless social movements remain incapable of making complex decisions together. We can raise awareness but we are still unable to win elections. American activism is lagging behind our comrades in Europe who have built powerful electoral movements such as Spain’s Podemos, Italy’s Five Star Movement and Iceland’s Pirate party. Until protesters in America are backed by a credible movement that can win elections and govern effectively, our street protests will remain a performative temper tantrum, at best. How to win elections and govern is the essential challenge that every genuine activist must now turn to solving. In the weeks and months ahead, I’ll continue the revolutionary experiments that I’ve begun in my tiny town in rural Oregon. I’m confident that if the collective creativity of American activism is oriented toward replicating the successes of electoral movements abroad then we can pull it off bigger than anyone else. So when people ask me if I’m joining the Women’s March in my community this weekend, or if I’ll be flying to DC to be raucous with my movement buddies during the inauguration, I tell them the truth: I’m staying here and preparing for the day after the march, when the protesters return home and are ready to get serious about building a social movement that uses protest to sweep the midterm elections in 2018. I’ll be waiting for you. Mary Jane Wells: An inauguration ball gives me a platform to highlight sexual consent I am a British-born actress and writer whose recent work revolves around sexual trauma. Tonight, I’m going to a ball celebrating the inauguration of a man who is the focus of at least 24 allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. What the hell am I doing? I was invited to the Vetty’s Presidential Inaugural Ball after working on a film called Holy Hell, about a sociopathic narcissist cult leader. So when I received an invite and the opportunity to speak for a few minutes in front of a crowd of US military top brass and – potentially – President Trump, I was torn. I live in a Californian echo chamber, where everything was sunshine, grapes and pantsuitable possibility. And then Trump won. I decided, despite my violent opposition to all he stands for, to attend the ball. I am not a celebrity, my boycott would mean nothing, and personal politics are inconsequential when there is an opportunity for a conversation about sexual consent, vulnerability and addiction to power with the leader of the free world – and especially this one. This is about leadership. We need more women in positions of military command, and access to an independent justice system for military sexual trauma (MST) survivors. We need women in the army to no longer be blamed with the old boys’ club adage of “You know what happens when you put boys and girls together …”. With a weak commander-in-chief, the values that sustain a prepared, cohesive military force also weaken, while sexual assault, bullying and mobbing systematically increase. During my moment on stage, I will stress the need for an independent inquiry into all incidences of MST. The US army is the most powerful in the world, and potentially an incredible force for peace. How is that peace ever achievable with an inward-looking system that potentially demands reporting to your own assailant? But such peace is a pipe dream unless it is brokered first between soldiers on the same side. I hope the crowd will listen. Nona Hurkmans: Our banners tell vulnerable people they are not alone What’s the point of protesting against an American president in the UK? What use is it? The point is visibility. And the use is showing our support to people who feel nervous about this presidency. This Friday, Bridges Not Walls – a collaboration between different organisations and individuals – is dropping banners with positive messages on more than 100 bridges (or mostly bridges) across the UK and around the world. Messages such as “Build bridges not walls”, “Still we rise” and “Queer solidarity smashes borders”. The aim is as simple as the action: to let vulnerable communities and individuals know that we stand with them. And there are a lot of these communities: women, Muslims, migrants, people of colour, disabled people, LGBTQ people, anyone whom Donald Trump has mocked, insulted, threatened to exclude or shown a complete lack of respect for. The list is long. The message we’re trying to put out is that we’re here, we’re with you, we’ll stand up for your rights, and we’re not going anywhere. And this message is not just for Americans. This isn’t just about Trump. In Britain, we’ve seen plenty of the language Trump has used, and it’s had an impact. Recorded hate crimes in the UK were up 41% in the month after the Brexit vote compared with the same month the year before. And who’s surprised, with the kind of billboards Nigel Farage sees fit to put up – a giant materialisation of a Trump tweet complete with visuals. “Breaking point” indeed. Even Theresa May couldn’t do better than to say she’s looking forward to working with the man who once suggested a female political opponent was too ugly to be elected.

On the eve of Trump’s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the “impostor and con-man” was “gearing up for a trade war” which would have “a very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world”. The “would-be-dictator … didn’t expect to win, he was surprised”, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held. “I personally have confidence that he’s going to fail … because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,” added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Soros said he expected financial markets to “not do very well” because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration. On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union – and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled. “In my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,” he said. “At the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. “This is going to take some time, but when it does happen they’ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won’t rise as fast as the cost of living. “The divorce is going to take a very long time.

But for the public the music was marred by some sound system glitches.<br></p> <p>Chris Lehman, 55, a maintenance supervisor from Belmar, New Jersey, said:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>It’s thrilling to be here today. This is a historic event. We’ve got a president again who’s proud of the country and will bring jobs back to the country. It’s a good feeling. He’s brought jobs back even before he’s taken the keys to the office yet. Unfortunately he’ll probably spend the first 20 days undoing the garbage President Obama did at the end to slow him down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lehman, 55, booked his hotel in nearby Baltimore before the election because he was so confident of Trump’s victory. </p> <p>“You don’t become a billionaire by losing and not knowing what you’re doing. He speaks his heart and he speaks his mind. You know what he’s saying is the truth and you’ve got to love a president like that. He doesn’t owe anybody anything. He can come in and do this right,” he said.</p> <p>Shannon Wilburn, 48, who runs a Christian youth centre, had travelled with a friend from Roby, Texas, for her first visit to the American capital. “We just wanted to be here as patriotic Americans. It’s a bucket list thing to see a swearing in of a president. I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian. One of the biggest things is his pro-life stance and, as a Christ follower, it’s very hard to accept someone who’s not.”</p> <p>Wilburn said she doubted that Trump will be able to bridge the partisan divide in his inaugural address on Friday. “They’re not even going to give him a day. Look at the Democrats boycotting it. He can’t get one day of grace. That’s a little frustrating, I think.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58814a24e4b00b8fc2ae2885"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T23:22:19.114Z"">11.22pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/822222349256822784"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Trump Family applauds at feet of Abraham Lincoln as fireworks spell out U-S-A. <a href=""https://t.co/N42taXOlau"">pic.twitter.com/N42taXOlau</a></p>&mdash; Mark Knoller (@markknoller) <a href=""https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/822222349256822784"">January 19, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881490de4b01065cf598801"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/davidsmith""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T23:19:08.080Z"">11.19pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><em>David Smith reports from the inauguration concert on the contrast between the Lincoln Memorial and the rhetoric from some Trump supporters.</em></p> <p>Some observers found the juxtaposition with Lincoln, who won the civil war and helped end slavery, jarring.

The campaign is over. Candidate Bush and candidate Obama were different from President Bush and President Obama.

Welcome Celebration inaugural concert in Washington on Thursday. </p> <p>The performers aptly mirrored the sensibility Trump so deeply tapped into. CBS-TV news correspondent Chris Van Cleef described the audience in the ticketed seats for the event as “not particularly diverse.”</p> <p>The free show, which proceeded at a glacial pace, began with the U.S. Army Band pumping out traditional instrumental marching music, followed by “The Star Spangled Banner.” More historic music came from The United Old Guard Fife and Drum Corp, who performed a medley of songs from the 18th and 19th century, while decked out in period military pomp.</p> <p>The first pop performer to take part - DJ RaviDrums (ne Ravi Jakhotia) - stressed the athletic side of percussion rather than the soul or groove of it. The Vegas-friendly star, who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner, bashed a drum set sprawling enough to entirely entrap him, while multiple screens flashed the names of every US state. </p> <p>A brief segment in his one-song set interpolated “America The Beautiful” as if it were being performed at a rave.</p> <p>Classic soul singer Sam Moore, of Sam &amp;amp; Dave legend, echoed Jakhotia’s song choice. He performed the anthem in a gospel-soul arrangement, recalling Ray Charles’ famous take on the song. Moore, best known for boomer touchstones like “Hang On, I’m Coming,” sang the song gamely, first with a lone piano accompaniment, then with a fine gospel choir backing him.</p> <p>A cobbled-together group (“The Frontmen of Country”) appeared, sifting together members of three second tier Nashville acts - Little Texas, Restless Heart and Lonestar.</p> <p>They offered a medley of songs saluting great American places - three of them set in Texas, all of them honoring the South. The songs including “The Bluest Skies of Texas,” “Amy’s Back In Austin,” “God Bless Texas,” and “Walking In Memphis,” a cover of the old Marc Cohn hit. The Frontmen’s set melded into a performance by 74 year old Lee Geenwood of his touchstone “God Bless The U.S.A.,” which brought the crowd to its feet. The song implicitly presents patriotism as something disfavored and, so, in need of defense against unmentioned foes.</p> <p>The sole rock act to appear qualifies for that genre to the same flimsy degree that Nickelback does. The band’s opening song called for people to “stand up and take back your world today” - a clear rebuke to the earlier administration.</p> <p>During a long lag between the performers, the sound system pumped out recordings by The Rolling Stones, including (bizarrely) “Let’s Spend The Night Together” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” (which Trump had used during his campaign stops).</p> <p>Early in the event, a speech broke up the musical entertainment. Actor Jon Voight presented Mr. Trump as a victim of a “grueling year,” fueled by a “barrage of propaganda” and all the “negative lies” fired his way. For an event meant to unite, Voight couldn’t have leaned harder into America’s wide divides.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58813ccae4b00b8fc2ae283c"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T22:27:15.177Z"">10.27pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>A fourth song!

Here’s a wrap up of our coverage today: Trump spent the day laying a wreath at the Arlington Cemetery and then bopping along awkwardly to B-list musicians at his Lincoln Memorial concert. On Obama’s final day in office he commuted 330 prison sentences, the most in one day of any US president. Sabrina Siddiqui wrote about Obama’s last hours as president - including a letter to Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Obama supporters spent his last day in office paying tribute t the 44th president. Many supporter have written letters to Obama: farewelling the hope and change president. Here’s a look at the up-and-coming leaders of the Trump resistance in Washington Same-sex couples have been rushing to get married before a Trump presidency. And tomorrow it begins. Tune in live coverage all day of the inauguration of Donald J Trump as president. It’s a day, as David Smith writes, that few expected would come - and many fear. Here’s your guide to the events in Washington tomorrow. Read the review for the first half of the inauguration concert here. The Piano Guys struck a more conciliatory note, announcing at one point “it’s time to put all our differences aside. When we do, it’s going to be okay.” Like Trump the foursome rose to power outside the usual system, initially using YouTube as their path to success rather than the major labels. The act lived up to its reputation for squeaky-clean family entertainment, offering an instrumental take on One Direction’s bubble gum hit “That’s What Makes You Beautiful.” For a flash of showmanship, three of the four members plucked the inner strings on the grand piano, making it seem less like a musical performance than a team sport. The show’s headliner - Toby Keith - struck a balance between outreach and outrage. At the end of his first number, “American Soldier,” a sincere salute to America’s veterans, he thanked outgoing President Obama for “his service.” But his four song set culminated in a hit that represents the most bellicose brand of patriotism possible. “Courtesy of the Red, White &amp; Blue (The Angry American),” presents America as an engine of vengeance with lyrics like: You’ll be sorry that you messed with The U S of A Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass It’s the American way! Same sex couples have been rushing down the aisle to get married before Donald Trump becomes president, reports Amber Jamieson: Ever since the 2015 US supreme court decision legalized same-sex marriages nationwide, partners Alicia Verdier and Erin Hansen had planned to get hitched. But the four and a half years of their relationship had been busy. Then Hillary Clinton lost the election. Verdier went to bed on 8 November heartbroken and awoke hours later, at 3am, in a state of panic. “All I could think was there was a possibility, with new supreme court nominees, we might lose our right to get married,” she said. She wasn’t alone. “I have so many friends who’ve gotten married in the last two months,” said Verdier. “Whatever else Trump may think he’s done, he’s caused a lot of gay people to get married. “I’m sure that wasn’t his plan, but that’s what he gets as his inauguration gift: all the gay people are getting married.” Read the rest here. On his final day as president, Barack Obama throws some shade on the incoming Trump administration using the White House Twitter account. David Smith reports from the inauguration concert: At last the president-elect appeared, his wife Melania at his side. He stood before the giant statue of a seated Abraham Lincoln and gave a military salute. He then turned and waved to the cheering crowd as Melania smiled. They descended the steps once graced by Martin Luther King when he delivered his ‘I have a dream’ speech, watched by a far smaller crowd than that day. Some chanted: “Trump! Trump! Trump!” The couple sat with other family members behind protective glass to enjoy country music and rock band 3 Doors Down against a backdrop of patriotic images on big screens. But for the public the music was marred by some sound system glitches. Chris Lehman, 55, a maintenance supervisor from Belmar, New Jersey, said: It’s thrilling to be here today. This is a historic event. We’ve got a president again who’s proud of the country and will bring jobs back to the country. It’s a good feeling. He’s brought jobs back even before he’s taken the keys to the office yet. Unfortunately he’ll probably spend the first 20 days undoing the garbage President Obama did at the end to slow him down. Lehman, 55, booked his hotel in nearby Baltimore before the election because he was so confident of Trump’s victory. “You don’t become a billionaire by losing and not knowing what you’re doing. He speaks his heart and he speaks his mind. You know what he’s saying is the truth and you’ve got to love a president like that. He doesn’t owe anybody anything. He can come in and do this right,” he said. Shannon Wilburn, 48, who runs a Christian youth centre, had travelled with a friend from Roby, Texas, for her first visit to the American capital. “We just wanted to be here as patriotic Americans. It’s a bucket list thing to see a swearing in of a president. I do believe Donald Trump is a Christian. One of the biggest things is his pro-life stance and, as a Christ follower, it’s very hard to accept someone who’s not.” Wilburn said she doubted that Trump will be able to bridge the partisan divide in his inaugural address on Friday. “They’re not even going to give him a day. Look at the Democrats boycotting it. He can’t get one day of grace. That’s a little frustrating, I think.” David Smith reports from the inauguration concert on the contrast between the Lincoln Memorial and the rhetoric from some Trump supporters. Some observers found the juxtaposition with Lincoln, who won the civil war and helped end slavery, jarring. Keith Stiggers, 25, who is African American, said: “When I saw that I was like, wow! Probably a lot of his supporters don’t like Lincoln and his legacy for the country. Is he going to uphold that legacy or is he going to do what he can to step on it?” Stiggers, a law student, had come with his fiancee out of curiosity. “We wanted to see an inauguration before life takes off for us, before we have kids. We’re here supporting the peaceful transfer of power.” The inaugural address will be crucial, Stiggers added. “I think he should definitely build bridges. He got a lot of support from the alt-right and now he should make it clear he is governing for all Americans. His speech is going to be very important; it’s going to dictate the pace of his presidency. “I think we should give Donald Trump a chance to lead and see where he takes the nation. The campaign is over. Candidate Bush and candidate Obama were different from President Bush and President Obama. A lot of people talk but now we’ll see him as actual leader.” Now the Trump family stand on stage, while “Glory Glory Hallelujah” plays and red and white fireworks go off over the Lincoln Memorial. “I’ll see you tomorrow. I don’t care frankly if it’s going to be beautiful or if it’s going to rain like crazy, makes no difference to me. I’ve got a feeling it’s going to be beautiful,” declares Trump. He leads the crowd in a chant of “make America great again”, adding “and I’ll add, greater than ever before”. He finishes with the immortal words “enjoy the fireworks!” He talks about going around the country with huge rallies in the final months of his campaign. “There was never an empty seat, like tonight,” says Trump. “We all knew that last month of the campaign... we knew that something special was happening,” he says. “The poll stared going up up up but they didn’t want to give us credit. Because they forgot about a lot of us,” he says, focusing on the campaign. “Well, you’re not forgotten any more,” he says to cheers. He then thanks his supporters, promising to work “so hard” and to bring jobs back, and not let other countries take US jobs any longer. It’s similar rhetoric to what you’d hear on a campaign rally: strengthen borders, jobs etc. “I’m just the messenger,” he begins. “This started out tonight of being a small little concert and then we thought of the idea of doing it in front of the Lincoln Memorial and people came by their thousands and thousands and here we are tonight, all the way back. “It’s a movement that began. It’s a movement like we’ve never seen anywhere in the world they say... it’s something that’s very very special,” says Trump. “The phrase, you all know it, half of your wearing the hat: Make America Great Again,” says Trump. Barrack turns to paying tribute to Trump. “Along the road we’ve had men who have left their footprints and the fingerprints and through the mortar and in the middle of this tidal basin... as you have expectations before you, I would like you to pay tribute to the courage, to the stuate, to the strengrth, to the loyalty of this man. “To the diversity, to put the campaigns behind us and united behind one man.“We can argue we can fight and tomorrow at 1130 we are one country and he will be the 45th president of the United States Donald Trump,” said Barrack. He takes to the stage. Toby Keith finishes and Tom Barrack, president of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, takes to the stage. “This is the most incredibly structures and setting I’ve ever seen, apart from the ones president-elect himself built,” said Barrack. He kicks off the with the song American Solider. Trump bops along in his seat. I’m an American soldier, an American, Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand, When liberty’s in jeopardy I will always do what’s right, I’m out here on the front lines, So you can sleep in peace tonight. American soldier, I’m an American. US Army band play a few marching band hits and then Toby Keith is introduced as “one of the most popular artists in history”. “It’s time to put all our differences aside,” said The Piano Guys. He has the whole crowd singing along to the song “It’s going to be OKAY” (the lyrics reflect the title). Stalwart patriotism, showy entertainment, and flagrant nostalgia rule the day at the Make American Great Again! Welcome Celebration inaugural concert in Washington on Thursday. The performers aptly mirrored the sensibility Trump so deeply tapped into. CBS-TV news correspondent Chris Van Cleef described the audience in the ticketed seats for the event as “not particularly diverse.” The free show, which proceeded at a glacial pace, began with the U.S. Army Band pumping out traditional instrumental marching music, followed by “The Star Spangled Banner.” More historic music came from The United Old Guard Fife and Drum Corp, who performed a medley of songs from the 18th and 19th century, while decked out in period military pomp. The first pop performer to take part - DJ RaviDrums (ne Ravi Jakhotia) - stressed the athletic side of percussion rather than the soul or groove of it. The Vegas-friendly star, who has served as a personal DJ for Hugh Hefner, bashed a drum set sprawling enough to entirely entrap him, while multiple screens flashed the names of every US state. A brief segment in his one-song set interpolated “America The Beautiful” as if it were being performed at a rave. Classic soul singer Sam Moore, of Sam &amp; Dave legend, echoed Jakhotia’s song choice. He performed the anthem in a gospel-soul arrangement, recalling Ray Charles’ famous take on the song. Moore, best known for boomer touchstones like “Hang On, I’m Coming,” sang the song gamely, first with a lone piano accompaniment, then with a fine gospel choir backing him. A cobbled-together group (“The Frontmen of Country”) appeared, sifting together members of three second tier Nashville acts - Little Texas, Restless Heart and Lonestar. They offered a medley of songs saluting great American places - three of them set in Texas, all of them honoring the South. The songs including “The Bluest Skies of Texas,” “Amy’s Back In Austin,” “God Bless Texas,” and “Walking In Memphis,” a cover of the old Marc Cohn hit. The Frontmen’s set melded into a performance by 74 year old Lee Geenwood of his touchstone “God Bless The U.S.A.,” which brought the crowd to its feet. The song implicitly presents patriotism as something disfavored and, so, in need of defense against unmentioned foes. The sole rock act to appear qualifies for that genre to the same flimsy degree that Nickelback does. The band’s opening song called for people to “stand up and take back your world today” - a clear rebuke to the earlier administration. During a long lag between the performers, the sound system pumped out recordings by The Rolling Stones, including (bizarrely) “Let’s Spend The Night Together” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” (which Trump had used during his campaign stops). Early in the event, a speech broke up the musical entertainment. Actor Jon Voight presented Mr. Trump as a victim of a “grueling year,” fueled by a “barrage of propaganda” and all the “negative lies” fired his way. For an event meant to unite, Voight couldn’t have leaned harder into America’s wide divides. A fourth song! Here Without You. Weirdly I seem to know the lyrics of these songs. This is their slower, more melancholic hit. Trump sways from side to side. Another song from 3 Doors Down? The crowd does not seem to be feeling this as much as the country songs from earlier. Wait, this is Kryptonite. What song were they playing earlier? Are they just playing the same song again? These songs sound the same. Now this is the closest Trump’s inauguration concert is going to get to a mainstream hit being performed live by the performer who wrote it: 3 Doors Down plays its hit from 2000, Kryptonite: Trump bops away in his seat to the song. The band kicks off with their 2016 song The Broken: This is the call to the broken. To all the ones who’ve been thrown away. This is the call to the broken. Stand up and take back your world today. Trump gets up from his seat to thank the performers. Now, 1990s nobodies 3 Doors Down begin. From David Smith, who is reporting from the Lincoln Memorial: The Make America Great Again! welcome celebration has just started with a military band playing on the Lincoln Memorial. Trump will speak: quite a juxtaposition with the statue of Abraham Lincoln and the spot where Martin Luther King gave the ‘I have a dream’ speech. There are thousands of people here but space for many, many more – it’s not a huge turnout. A lot are wearing ‘Make America great again’ baseball caps and other regalia like at the rallies. Trump, who is known for being a Rolling Stones and Andrea Bocelli fan, seems to be enjoying the concert as he bops in his seat, but doesn’t seem to know the songs. Then, Lee Greenwood appears to sing his hit I’m Proud to Be An American. Trump joins in to sing the words “god bless the USA”. “Let’s take things up a notch here”, one of the musicians yells, as he breaks into God Blessed Texas: I’ve seen a lot of places I’ve been around the world I’ve been seen pretty faces Been with some beautiful girls After all I’ve witnessed One thing still amazes me Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe Trump is awkwardly bopping in his chair, while the country band Frontmen of Country play cover tunes such as Walking in Memphis and Amy’s Back in Austin. Donald Trump and Melania announced to the crowd, coming out to the soundtrack of Rolling Stone’s Heart of Stone. He and Melania walk down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. They wave to the crowd, as everyone takes photos and claps. The image of Trump and Melania in front of the Lincoln memorial was a very powerful one, just in case anyone was still in disbelief that this is happening. Will post as soon as available. Trump stands next to his family, pumping his fist at the crowd. Army Old Guard band played classic Americana marching bands songs. Now we’re waiting for Donald Trump to appear, with Rolling Stones’ Let’s Send the Night Together playing (just a recording, obviously, the band. Apparently they were Trump’s top pick to play, but they refused). Now Trump rally regular, The Stones’ Can’t Always Get What You Want is playing, which seems particularly poignant today. That was a pretty great version of America the Beautiful. Now it’s a military band, US Army Old Guard Fife and and Drum Corps, in revolutionary era outfits. Very “traditionally American”. Now Jon Voight, actor and father of Angelina Jolie, appears. “This is some day,” he begins. “He certainly didn’t need this job. And yes, God answered all our prayers,” he says, speaking of Trump. “And president Lincoln who sits here with us is smiling knowing we will be lead by a honest and good man, who will work for all their people no matter their creed or color”,” says Voight. He introduces soul singer Sam Moore to sing America the Beautiful. (so far all the performers, minus Voight, have been people of color, I stand corrected). Now it’s time for the “rhythmic beats” of DJ Ravidrums, a party DJ and former musical director of the 2009 NBC series Howie Do It. His soaring drumming is accompanied by screens showing the stars and stripes and names of the states. Vermont! Virginia! A very chipper version of the national anthem just sung by an Asian man in military marching band uniform, one of the few performers of color we’ll see today. After some warm-up numbers by a military band, it’s now time to rise for the presentation of colors and the national anthem. The Trump family - Eric, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Tiffany, plus spouses and the older grandkids - have taken their seats for the inauguration concert. Some nice behind the scenes pics from Bloomberg reporter Justin Sink: Trump’s Make America Great Again: Welcome Celebration, also known as the concert no big name performer wanted to attend, kicks off in five minutes. The artists who will play include country singer Toby Keith, 90s rock band 3 Doors Down, Republican country star Lee Greenwood and YouTube stars The Piano Guys (no, we don’t know who they are). Lots of stars, including Elton John and Andrea Bocelli, declined to perform. When asked why Kanye West, the highly influential hip hop star who created controversy amongst fans with his visit to Trump Tower in December, wasn’t asked to perform, a spokesman for Trump said West wasn’t “traditionally American” enough. “He’s been great, he considers himself a friend of the president-elect, but it’s not the venue... It’s going to be typically and traditionally American,” said Tom Barrack, chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee on CNN. West was born in Chicago and has won 21 Grammys. This West song, a duet with Jay-Z, would have been a pretty great inauguration song, regardless of the president. Photos of Trump and Pence during the ceremony at Arlington Cemetery. A military musician performs the Last Post. Trump and Pence then turn, face the Trump family and is led away in silence. Now president-elect Trump and Mike Pence are laying a white wreath of flowers on the tomb. They stop and stand back, in silence. Trump is wearing a blue tie, Pence is in red. A military drummer starts playing and the pair raise their arms across their hearts. The Trump children and grandchildren have all appeared (but not Barron, the youngest Trump son). Now live: Donald Trump and VP-elect Mike Pence is about to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider. After today’s senate confirmation hearings, Senator Tim Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton’s veep pick, says he opposes Tom Price, Trump’s nominee for Health secretary. Price has been drilled in the hearings over his stock trades in health companies. Can Donald Trump make America great again? Donald Trump has just left the President’s Guest House, as known Blair’s House, and is driving over to Arlington National Cemetery for the wreath-laying ceremony. Seems like government has really gone to the dogs. After Donald Trump’s comments on the weekend saying that civil rights leader and Congressman John Lewis should focus on his “falling apart” district rather than criticize Trump, reporter Jamiles Lartey headed down to Atlanta to examine Lewis’ district: Writes Lartey: On a quiet stretch of Georgia road, a red Ferrari zips by a golf course and past a string of well-appointed brick colonials with ornate driveway pillars – the kind that sometimes feature stone lions atop standing guard. Up the road, by a Starbucks and a bookstore, more fancy cars line the parking lot as a diverse, well-dressed crowd filters through. “This is Buckhead,” said Alexander Johnson, who runs a media training company and lives nearby. “It is not crime infested, nor is it falling apart.” Read there rest here. Breitbart News reporter Charlie Spiering is already in position for the inauguration concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial today. At least someone is excited for Toby Keith! Perhaps the only genuinely funny moment in the entire Senate nomination hearings: former Texas governor Rick Perry, Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary, told Senator (and former Saturday Night Live comedian) Al Franken that he hoped “you’re as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch”. In less amusing Perry news, Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders tried - and failed - to get Perry to admit climate change was a “crisis”. The former Dancing with the Stars contestant also said he “regrets” his past calls to nix his Energy Department he’s now been asked to lead. All aboard Cathy’s Train! Molly Redden interviewed Cathy Heller, who in October came forward in the Guardian to accuse Donald Trump of forcibly kissing her. She was the ninth woman to publicly accuse him of unwanted sexual contact, and after seeing Trump win the election, was spurred into attending the Women’s March on Washington this Saturday. As Redden explains: Cathy Heller was looking for transportation to the Women’s March on Washington when she kept running into the same problem. On the morning of the march, every train leaving New York Penn Station for DC was sold out. A few phone calls later, she found herself entreating an Amtrak salesperson: how many women would she have to organize before Amtrak agreed to add another car? ... About a week after Amtrak alerted her that they had added more cars, she had commitments from 43 women (and a few men) ready to travel with her to Washington. They’re calling themselves Cathy’s Train. Read the rest here. Schoolchildren from Brooklyn, New York, read letters they wrote to Donald Trump ahead of his inauguration. Where is this? This is a gorgeous room. A total genius must have built this place. -- Donald Trump on the “Presidential Ballroom” (yes that its name) during a luncheon for his top donors at the Trump International Hotel in DC. Today Trump hosted a luncheon for top donors, with many of his cabinet nominees in attendance. The event took place, of course, at the new Trump International Hotel in DC. “We have by far the highest IQ of any cabinet every accepted,” said Trump, although only a handful of the nominees have been confirmed following senate hearings. Trump mentioned several of his cabinet picks by name, pointing out Education Secretary pick Betsy DeVos, who has been grilled by Elizabeth Warren, Chris Murphy and Bernie Sanders this week in intense senate hearings. Trump said he and DeVos share “a different take” on education than past administrations. “It’s called: we want our children educated,” said Trump, to laughter from the crowd. Donald Trump won’t be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States until tomorrow, but the inauguration ceremonies kick off today, with a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery at 3.30pm ET. Then, at 4pm, it’s time for the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration, the inauguration concert that Trump has struggled to get any A-list stars to agree to perform at. Country singer Toby Keith and 90s rock band 3 Doors Down will be there, and there are rumors of other performers attending but keeping it quiet, presumably not wanting to attract the criticism that caused Tony and Grammy-award winning singer Jennifer Holliday to back out (she called it a “lapse of judgement” and noted that she didn’t want to upset her LGBT fans). Nicole Puglise has put together this comprehensive guide to the next few days’ events. She adds: Numerous unofficial galas and balls will take place, both celebrating Trump and saying goodbye to Obama (though attendees be warned: you may have trouble finding a “great dress” to wear if you haven’t bought one already, the president-elect told the New York Times). Some are planned for inauguration eve. The country band Big &amp; Rich will perform at the Great America Alliance Inaugural Gala, Rolling Stone reported. The DeploraBall will include an event on Thursday at the National Press Club as well as a gala event on Friday at the William F Bolger Center in Potomac, Maryland. At the Garden State Presidential Inaugural Gala, hosted by the New Jersey State Society, the B Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen tribute band, was slated to play – but they’ve since bowed out of the event. Peace Ball, organized by Busboys and Poets, will be held at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and “What To DO When You’re Expecting The WORST”, hosted by Jezebel and Fusion, at the Josephine Butler Parks Center, according to the Washington Post. On Facebook, more than 40,000 people have said they will attend a “Thanks, Obama” event on his last day in office. The original idea was for attendees to gather outside the White House and clap to show their appreciation for the outgoing president, but because of inauguration logistics, the event has moved to a private venue in the district, DCist reported. How celebrities will protest around Trump’s inaugurationRead more Also on Thursday evening: Common, the National, and others will perform at “Show Up!”, an event supporting Planned Parenthood. Reporters Lauren Gambino, Sabrina Siddiqui, Ben Jacobs and David Smith will be dropping in to as many of these events as they can, and speaking to Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters, as the latter start to arrive in DC ahead of the Women’s March on Saturday.

Out of fuzzy goals and all the different views there will be a pulling into focus. Sure, I remember the anti-apartheid marches with their clear and obvious objectives, but I also remember Greenham Common and the miners’ strike, which we lost. In both victory and loss however, understanding the power of defiance and collectivity is something to experience. Yes, that is old-fashioned, that feeling of solidarity, of walking beside others. The unfurling of banners and daft placards, the aching feet and children in pushchairs, the forging of bonds and the actual fun of protest. Some people will be there to make themselves feel better as well as make the world a better place. That’s how it works. One of today’s goals is surely to energise and connect women, to say to those who feel under attack: we are here too. You go on ahead. We have got your back. All of us have seen the disconnection of many from any kind of politics and also the disconnection between social movements such as Occupy from electoral politics. The prize is now to connect. Those who would take away women’s rights have already mobilised their anger and frustration and many have been slow to realise it. We now have to do the same thing. We will be seen and heard.",4680,Suzanne Moore,2017-01-20T18:30:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/suzannemoore"">Suzanne Moore</a>",37,2017-01-21,true,NA,NA,NA,NA

What makes it Trump specific is one particular reference: “I thought the best way to perfect our tree / Is by building walls / Walls like unicorns,” which suggests that walls are an illusory answer to problems. And then: “It is love, that is the root of all evil,” which is the opposite of what songs usually suggest, but which seems apposite in the wake of Trump taking to the stage on Thursday night to the strains of the Rolling Stones’ Heart of Stone. As with Arcade Fire, Gorillaz have reined in the poppiness here, as if they very much do not want anyone to think “BANGER!” and ignore the message.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDUrpPvU1_4""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CDUrpPvU1_4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Early Turner – No Hallelujah (Song of a Blowhard)</h2> <p>Early Turner is Tom Gray, from 1998 Mercury winners Gomez, and this song – also released this week – is meant to be therapeutic. Unlike the last two, he’s happy to pair his despairing lyrics to a lovely folk-pop melody. But despair it does: “If you believe him / You watch a monster grow,” Gray begins, insisting “until the penny drops / No hallelujah will be sung” for the “blowhard on a wall”. But he recognises the key issue here is the enabling of Trump: “How did we get so dumb?” A question that might be as well <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/16/michael-gove-cheesy-puff-donald-trump-interview"">aimed at Michael Gove</a> as those who voted for the new president.</p>  <figure class=""element element-audio"" data-canonical-url=""https://soundcloud.com/earlyturner/no-hallelujah-song-of-a-blowhard""> <iframe width=""460"" height=""460"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F303493072&show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Fiona Apple – Tiny Hands</h2> <p>Not so much a song as a chant. Which is fine, because that’s what it’s meant to be – a rallying call for Saturday’s women’s march on Washington. The only lyric is “We don’t want your tiny hands anywhere near our underpants”, paired with a sample of Trump intoning “Grab ’em by the pussy.” Trump never seems to be perturbed by reasoned criticism, by anger. What he hates is mockery, especially the suggestion that his hands might be small, and that might reflect on another part of his anatomy. In which case, Fiona Apple, job done.</p>  <figure class=""element element-audio"" data-canonical-url=""https://soundcloud.com/michael-whalen-997591802/little-hands-womens-march-chant-featuring-fiona-apple""> <iframe width=""460"" height=""460"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F303184466&show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Coco Rosie feat Anohni – Smoke ’Em Out</h2> <p>According to the New York artpop duo, “Smoke ’Em Out welcomes the new character who will be occupying the White House with a mob of women and children armed with forks and knives. In the wake of this unnatural disaster, we feel a call to rise, shout and burn the house down. The future is female.” To be honest, it’s hard to discern that from the lyrics, certainly the opening verse – if you can infer the political message from “Baloney sandwich lonely clowns / Smoke laugh toke craft / Porn blood piss grass / Piss miss heart hand” you are substantially sharper than I am. What might be clarity comes from Anohni’s chorus, assuming the house refers to the White House: “Burning down the house / Smoke them out / I was on the brink like so many times / Got children and wives waving forks and knives / Burning down the house / The dead girl shouts / Smoke them out!” It is not quite <a draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbddqXib814"">Which Side Are You On?</a> in terms of its forthrightness.

A protest song that is intended not just to capture a moment, but to be applicable in other circumstances. Gorillaz feat Benjamin Clementine – Hallelujah Money Released on inauguration eve, Gorillaz’ response to the rise of Trump is elliptical, dwelling not so much on what might happen but on the way money corrupts (and, yes, Damon Albarn is probably aware of the ironies of a rich rock star who can do whatever he wants putting out a song on this subject). What makes it Trump specific is one particular reference: “I thought the best way to perfect our tree / Is by building walls / Walls like unicorns,” which suggests that walls are an illusory answer to problems. And then: “It is love, that is the root of all evil,” which is the opposite of what songs usually suggest, but which seems apposite in the wake of Trump taking to the stage on Thursday night to the strains of the Rolling Stones’ Heart of Stone. As with Arcade Fire, Gorillaz have reined in the poppiness here, as if they very much do not want anyone to think “BANGER!” and ignore the message. Early Turner – No Hallelujah (Song of a Blowhard) Early Turner is Tom Gray, from 1998 Mercury winners Gomez, and this song – also released this week – is meant to be therapeutic. Unlike the last two, he’s happy to pair his despairing lyrics to a lovely folk-pop melody. But despair it does: “If you believe him / You watch a monster grow,” Gray begins, insisting “until the penny drops / No hallelujah will be sung” for the “blowhard on a wall”. But he recognises the key issue here is the enabling of Trump: “How did we get so dumb?” A question that might be as well aimed at Michael Gove as those who voted for the new president. Fiona Apple – Tiny Hands Not so much a song as a chant. Which is fine, because that’s what it’s meant to be – a rallying call for Saturday’s women’s march on Washington. The only lyric is “We don’t want your tiny hands anywhere near our underpants”, paired with a sample of Trump intoning “Grab ’em by the pussy.” Trump never seems to be perturbed by reasoned criticism, by anger. What he hates is mockery, especially the suggestion that his hands might be small, and that might reflect on another part of his anatomy. In which case, Fiona Apple, job done. Coco Rosie feat Anohni – Smoke ’Em Out According to the New York artpop duo, “Smoke ’Em Out welcomes the new character who will be occupying the White House with a mob of women and children armed with forks and knives. In the wake of this unnatural disaster, we feel a call to rise, shout and burn the house down. The future is female.” To be honest, it’s hard to discern that from the lyrics, certainly the opening verse – if you can infer the political message from “Baloney sandwich lonely clowns / Smoke laugh toke craft / Porn blood piss grass / Piss miss heart hand” you are substantially sharper than I am. What might be clarity comes from Anohni’s chorus, assuming the house refers to the White House: “Burning down the house / Smoke them out / I was on the brink like so many times / Got children and wives waving forks and knives / Burning down the house / The dead girl shouts / Smoke them out!” It is not quite Which Side Are You On? in terms of its forthrightness. On the other hand, it is the closest thing to a banger of these five.",4199,Michael Hann,2017-01-26T23:15:00Z,false,NA,"<a href=""profile/michaelhann"">Michael Hann</a>",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you. Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we’ve defended other nations’ borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us: “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.” We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",8362,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,2017-01-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But some of the most fascinating conversations about climate-change in India are about reducing demand.</p> <p>India is a society undergoing enormous changes. Between now and 2040, the population of its cities will swell by an estimated 315m people – roughly the current population of the US. Over the next years, the estimated 240m Indians who currently lack access to electricity will be connected to the grid. The half-billion Indians who still rely on fuel wood for cooking will transition to using stoves. And <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-awakening-in-india"">by some rough projections</a>, around 70% of the buildings that will exist in India in 2030 are yet to be built.</p>    <p>Experts such as <strong>Navroz Dubash </strong>aren’t just thinking about how to power these changes, but how to lock in systems – of moving, cooking, cooling and lighting – that use a fraction of the energy it takes to power the same tasks in the west.</p> <p>One example he gives is appliances. The Indian government has started paying rebates to manufacturers who can produce more energy efficient 40-watt fans to reduce the drain during the nation’s sweltering summers.</p> <p>A bigger example – hundreds of thousands of high rises will spring up across Indian cities in the next 15 years. Energy researcher <strong>Radhika Khosla </strong>points out: building them to capture natural sunlight will reduce dependence on electric light.</p> <p>These opportunities exist across every sector. Investing in rail freight networks would use less energy, long-term, than trucking freight by road. Convincing Indians to cook using gas, instead of electricity, would also substantially cut energy use. Transport emissions too could be slashed if the hundreds of millions of Indians who flood into cities in the next decades could work within a short distance of their homes. </p> <p>“There’s a way to lock in institutional changes, technological changes and behavioural changes that are very difficult to undo,” Khosla says. “And that opportunity exists for countries like India, that are on the verge of great transitions.”</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881aa9de4b00b8fc2ae2a5d"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/oliver-holmes""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T06:39:46.179Z"">6.39am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp"" data-alt=""Snow""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp"">Snow</a> </figure>  <p>Now we move to Mongolia, which is experiencing a disaster called a <em>dzud</em>, an extreme weather phenomenon commonly comprising heavy snow falls and temperatures below -40C.<br></p> <p>The <em>dzud</em> starves livestock as they are unable to graze, which in turn can devastate Mongolians, a third of whom are entirely dependent on livestock.</p>    <p>The country used to suffer <em>dzuds</em> every decade or so but recently they have been occurring with growing frequency. This one is the second in a row.</p> <p>The full extent of the <em>dzud</em> will not be known until the end of spring but last year’s killed more than 1.1 million livestock and left hundreds of thousands of Mongolian herders living on the brink.</p> <p>Months of consistently heavy snow coverage and arctic temperatures have sparked fears of another devastating humanitarian crisis. The government has called for donations of warm clothing, food, medication for livestock, coal, hay, animal feed, insulation materials and other useful items for herders to help them survive the winter while preventing livestock deaths.</p> <p>Some areas of the country have already recorded temperatures as low as -50C and local media reports that more than 70% of Mongolia is covered with thick snow and ice.</p> <p>A <em>dzud</em> typically arrives after a summer drought or an early winter snow that melts then freezes over the land, cutting off food for livestock. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and insufficient grasslands for large herds of livestock.</p> <p>Telmen Erdenebileg, Save the Children’s humanitarian program manager in Mongolia, is leading the organisation’s <em>dzud</em> response and has just returned from one of the worst affected provinces, Arkhangai. </p> <p>“The coming months are critical for herder families in the most heavily impacted areas. The end of winter is when stores of hay and fodder run out, and if there’s another large snowfall or temperatures remain so low we could see massive numbers of animals dying of starvation once again,” he told the Guardian from Ulaanbaator.</p> <p>“Just last week herders told me how they lost half or even three quarters of their herd last winter, and they are worried about what awaits them in the next few months. Livestock are everything out there: a source of food, nutritious milk, warm clothing with their skins and a commodity for trade or sale. Without animals, herders have no livelihood.</p> <p>Last year, Save the Children’s response to the <em>dzud</em> included distributing animal fodder and veterinary packages, fuel to help hospitals and schools, and cash grants for the most vulnerable families to buy essentials like warm clothing and nutritious food.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T07:08:45.827Z"">at 7.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5881a909e4b01065cf5989e1"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/oliver-holmes""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T06:31:51.481Z"">6.31am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Suppakorn Chinvanno</strong>, at <a href=""http://www.start.or.th/index.php/about-us"">Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok</a>, has been creating maps that show dramatically how temperature changes will affect the Southeast Asia region, if high CO2 emission continues.</p> <p>Below is a map of Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, as well as parts of Myanmar and Malaysia.

For future threats, go 1,300km northwest to Mumbai, India’s flashy financial capital – and the world’s climate-vulnerable megacity.</p> <p>To start with, much of the city was actually built on water: by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/30/story-cities-11-reclamation-mumbai-bombay-megacity-population-density-flood-risk"">rubble poured</a> into the seas and swamps that separated seven islets in the Arabian sea. That process of reclamation continues today, and has severely distorted the terrain’s ability to deal even with unexceptional rainfall. A <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/nclimate1979_T2.html"">2013 study</a> found flooding would cost Mumbai around US$6.4b each year by 2050.</p> <p>It also means huge swathes of the city are low-lying. If sea levels rise at predicted rates, according to early research, around 40% of Mumbai could be <a href=""http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/almost-40-mumbai-may-be-submerged-in-next-100-years-study/story-dV4uWTtJRPaBwvjOggfCVO.html"">submerged by the end</a> of the century.</p>    <p>A day of freak rainfall in July 2005 saw chest-high flooding in parts of the city and killed 500 people. But the real nightmare scenario is a category 4 or 5 storm blowing in from the Arabian sea. A new book by <strong>Amitav Ghosh</strong>, one of India’s best-known writers, imagines this very scenario.</p> <p>In the event of a two-to-three metre storm surge, Ghosh writes:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>“Waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm surge would meet and merge. In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once again become islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Luckily, no storm like that has been seen in Mumbai in recent memory. But meteorologists are nearly unanimous in the view that increasing global temperatures will make tropical storms more severe. And a 2012 paper cited by Ghosh in his book predicts a 46% increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Arabian sea over the course of the century.</p>    <p>Is Mumbai ready – either for “the big one”, or even just increased floods? I asked <strong>Atul Deulgoankar</strong>, an author and member of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority. He said: </p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>“I’ve been part of the disaster management authority since its inception in 2006. In that time, not a single government, not a single chief minister or chief secretary has taken an interest in disaster-risk reduction. In 2005, we experienced heavy flooding because just one river was choked. And nothing has been done about that. There has been no campaign to clear water bodies or rivers. Nothing is happening systematically.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58818f78e4b00b8fc2ae29e1"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T05:04:02.078Z"">5.04am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/creatures-zip/giv-39025b3WDuFnzOui"" data-alt=""Creatures""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/creatures-zip/giv-39025b3WDuFnzOui"">Creatures</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Tim Flannery</strong>, Australian palaeontologist, environmentalist and member of the Climate Council has penned a sobering opinion piece in the Guardian today, outlining the threat climate change is posing to Australia’s unique wildlife. </p> <p>And as he says, meanwhile, Australia is doing very little to improve their outlook:</p> <blockquote> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>...while other countries are winding down their coal use, Australia is attempting to ramp up our production and export of the product, all the while as we watch first-hand the immediate and long term damage coal and fossil fuels are wreaking on our planet, on people and on nature.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>You can read the full piece here:</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/20/the-threat-to-species-from-climate-change-should-provoke-shame-in-our-hearts"">The threat to species from climate change should provoke shame in our hearts | Tim Flannery</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58818f1ae4b01065cf59895b"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T05:02:05.417Z"">5.02am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Naveen Rabelli</strong>, a 35-year-old engineer, wanted to show the power and potential of clean energy, so he designed and built a solar powered tuk-tuk and drove it 9,000 miles from India to the UK.</p> <p>“The moment I tell them it doesn’t require petrol, their minds are blown,” he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/solar-powered-tuk-tuk-reaches-uk-road-trip-india"">said in September last year</a> after he arrived in Dover following a seven month-long journey. </p> <p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/10154976931721323/"">His journey shows there</a> is a sustainable alternative for the millions of tuk-tuks around the world.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""video embed"">  <iframe src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftheguardian%2Fvideos%2F10154976931721323%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=400&amp;height=400"" style=""max-width:400px;max-height:400px"" allowtransparency=""true"" allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" height=""400"" width=""400""></iframe> </figure>  <p>Read more about Rabelli’s journey here.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/solar-powered-tuk-tuk-reaches-uk-road-trip-india"">Solar-powered tuk-tuk reaches UK after road trip from India</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58819709e4b0f0efb00f6049"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T05:01:42.765Z"">5.01am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR 22: Even more extreme climate</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Two more hours until we’ve gone round the world in 24 hours of climate change – thanks for following along, and particularly for the lively discussion below the line.

In Australia, we have a number of climate deniers <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/tony-abbott-australia-suspend-aid-palestinian-authority"">both in the government</a> and in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/debunking-malcolm-roberts-the-case-against-a-climate-science-denier"">the rest of the parliament</a>. We also have a federal government that has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/22/australias-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-rising-official-figures-show"">no effective policies to curb carbon emissions</a>. Do you think climate deniers are driving climate policy here in Australia. And if so, what is the best strategy to fight them?</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Mann: </strong>Sadly, climate change deniers do indeed continue to have a voice in our public and policy discourse that is out of proportion with the merit of their views, thanks in large part to a megaphone that they have been granted by conservative media. The Murdoch media empire in particular – whose role is featured in <a href=""https://www.amazon.com.au/d/ebook/Madhouse-Effect-Climate-Threatening-Destroying-Politics-Driving/B01HH5L6CG/"">our recent book</a> ‘The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy” — has played a particularly vital role in the climate change disinformation campaign, and they dominate the news industry in Australia.</p> <p>Keep in mind that the second largest shareholder in NewsCorps, after Rupert Murdoch, is the Saudi Royal family, who obviously have a stake in our continued addiction to fossil fuels. As a consequence, they dominate the public discourse and provide cover for climate change-denying politicians. It is hardly surprising this has led to climate policy in Australia being driven by fossil fuel interests and their advocates. </p> <p>As for strategies to fight them, one of them is to speak out and to hold them accountable—which is something I do actively, whether it is speaking to the media, giving public lectures, writing commentaries and op-eds, and books. My ‘Madhouse Effect” lecture is really about how to move beyond climate change denial and get on to the legitimate debate about what to do about the threat of human-caused climate change.</p> <p><strong>Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change?</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Mann: </strong>We must hold our elected representatives responsible for representing our interests rather than the profits of polluting interests.

But it doesn’t have much of a plan to deal with the effects of climate change, says <strong>David Morris</strong>, head of the Environmental Defenders Office.</p> <p>He tells the Guardian there have been some “positive noises” from the newly elected Labor government around renewable energy and increased funding and incentives, but notes that it’s one of the few jurisdictions without an adequate and current coastal management plan.</p>    <p>“I doubt you could find many capital cities around the world that don’t have a coastal management strategy, that don’t have a climate change adaptation plan, and the Northern Territory is a place which is going to feel the effects of climate severely.</p> <p>“New roads, new pipelines, housing development, any kind of infrastructure you want to put in, any kind of decision you want to make under legislation where you’re spending public money, should now take into account climate change.</p> <p>“When you look at NT government information about climate change, it’s scant, there’s basically nothing. I mean, we’ve got sea level rise and that’s it.”</p> <p>Morris says current estimates are a sea level rise of 1.1m by 2100 would see between 250 and 400 residential buildings inundated by seawater, and would put 200km of NT roads, valued at just under AU $2 billion, at risk.</p> <p>Ecologically and economically significant tourism areas like Kakadu national park are also under threat, with increasing risks of saltwater intrusion threatening the fragile wetlands.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58818e5de4b00b8fc2ae29dc"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T04:13:23.331Z"">4.13am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/guardian/status/822285019922038785"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GlobalWarning?src=hash"">#GlobalWarning</a>: the global sea level has risen 8cm since 1993 <a href=""https://t.co/3n8F5fS2EE"">https://t.co/3n8F5fS2EE</a> <a href=""https://t.co/S4DRX380gG"">pic.twitter.com/S4DRX380gG</a></p>&mdash; The Guardian (@guardian) <a href=""https://twitter.com/guardian/status/822285019922038785"">January 20, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58818a4de4b01065cf598946"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T04:09:00.837Z"">4.09am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR 21: Blue skies belie pollution</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>We’re in the final stretch now.

We have the power to decide who governs us and what issues made the priority agenda no matter what vested interests do or say to stymie action. And as consumers we have huge power to decide where our money goes.</p> <p>Anyone concerned about climate change needs to engage in politics, call your elected officials, email them, meet them at events and tell them you want urgent action or you’ll vote them out. Talk to people about it in your community, take steps together locally to make a difference. And think hard about what you are doing with your money. If you don’t like what your bank or superfund is investing in – say fossil fuel projects – tell them that and move to one that is fossil free.</p> <p>Finally, get involved with a group or issue you care about – help us stop the Adani coal mine, take on Chevron’s plans to drill in the Bight, switch your power company from the big three to a company investing in and campaigning for renewable energy. If you don’t have time, donate to keep the campaigning alive. Any one of these steps will make a real difference. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881868fe4b0f0efb00f5ffb"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T03:44:55.594Z"">3.44am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/action-zip/giv-3902R2F0QWyB3oxX"" data-alt=""Activism""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/action-zip/giv-3902R2F0QWyB3oxX"">Activism</a> </figure>  <p>Here’s another part of the Q&amp;A I did with 350.org Australia’s chief executive <strong>Blaire</strong> <strong>Palese. </strong>Here she discusses the recent suceses of the climate movement, and what we’re going to see this year.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Despite some big setbacks, the climate movement has claimed some victories too. It now looks like the whole movement in Australia is focussing on stopping Adani building the Carmichael Coal mine. What will that campaign look like?</p> <p><strong>Blaire </strong><strong>Palese</strong></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/06/city-of-sydney-council-divest-fossil-fuels-regardless-election-result"">divestment</a> of more than A$6 trillion (US$5.2 trillion) from fossil fuels is something I and the 350.org team are particularly proud of. The campaign started off very much as a symbolic effort. But much to our amazement after three years, it was all about money – and lots of it! – being moved from coal, oil and gas. Some 688 institutions and 58,399 individuals across 76 countries have committed to divest in some way.

Australia hasn’t opened up a new mineral reserve in 40 years, and if the Adani project goes ahead, the whole Galilee Basin could be developed, which would unleash enough coal to tip the carbon budget not just for us, but for the whole world. A broad coalition of environmental groups, local communities and Traditional Owners are coming together to do all we can to ensure this project doesn’t see the light of day.

I asked her a series of questions about the climate movement here and abroad. Here’s the first question and answer:</p> <p><strong>Question: </strong>The rise of Trump in the US, and the continued lack of federal action on climate change here in Australia, must be seen in some ways as a failure of the climate movement. What lessons can be learned from what’s happened in recent years and how can the climate movement win?</p> <p><strong>Blair Palese: </strong></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Climate change is an incredibly difficult issue for people to get their heads around. Complex, yes, but more importantly, made confusing by media with vested interests questioning climate change science – a tactic straight out of the tobacco playbook. Understanding that science is never 100% certain is not something most of us think much about, so it’s easily exploited. And, as our movement is up against the most cashed up industry in the world – the fossil fuel industry – it’s a David vs Goliath battle to convince people and politicians that the longer we wait, the harder and more expensive are the steps we must take to stop climate change.</p> <p>That said, those working on the issue do need to reach out more broadly to everyone, everywhere about the importance of the issue and ensure our movement spans the political, race, gender and age spectrum to be truly representative. It’s worth remembering that the People’s Climate Marches of 2015 saw more than 600,000 people take to the streets in 175 countries -- by all accounts the biggest thing of its kind in history.</p> <p>Our job now is not only to raise the alarm about climate change but to communicate the huge benefits we will all get from solving it. Our voices need to be loud and varied if we are to successfully stand up to fossil fuel dollars. </p> </blockquote> <p>Come back soon to see some more Q&amp;A’s with Blaire.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58818002e4b01065cf598910"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T03:14:52.170Z"">3.14am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>The <a href=""https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/"">Homeward Bound Project</a> aims to take 1000 women working in science around the world to Antarctica to increase their influence and impact in policy and decision-making.<br></p> <p><strong>Belinda Fairbrother</strong>, the community conservation manager at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, was part of the inaugural contingent of 76 women to spend 22 days in Antarctica in December: the largest-ever female expedition to Earth’s southernmost continent.</p> <p>She said the impacts of climate change were keenly felt there, with the Antarctic peninsula was among the fastest-warming places in the world and penguin populations suffering.</p> <p>“It really brings home the challenges we face elsewhere in the world.”</p>    <p>Having met scientists at Palmer Station, a US station in the Antarctic, she realised that no progress was possible alone, and that storytelling was as important as facts in mobilising people to act.</p> <p>“In these remote landscapes, that’s what really struck me – we need to work together, past issues and conflict. Going forward, that radical collaboration is what we’re going to need to deal with climate change as a global issue.” </p> <p>Hearing personal accounts of knowledgeable people experiencing the effects

I believe if the general public were to know how climate change will impact on their day to day living, as well as when these changes will occur, there would be many more involved in climate action. But scientists are conservative creatures and putting up such predictions would inevitably be very difficult due to inherent uncertainties in the modelling, which relies on very complex algorithms. There would also be cries from the tired old deniers of alarmism which may cause wholesale derailment of any climate action.

China’s leaders view climate change mitigation as an effective argument with which to take on the powerful energy sector responsible for the smog, which is blamed for up to one million premature deaths per year.</p> <p>Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Beijing sees huge economic benefits in transitioning towards a consumption and services based low carbon economy and becoming a world-leader in the energy technologies of the future. Already <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/06/china-cementing-global-dominance-of-renewable-energy-and-technology"">its global dominance of the renewables market</a> is becoming clear through billions of dollars of overseas investment last year in countries from Australia to Brazil and Pakistan.</p> <p>China is now the world’s largest investor in clean energy and recently unveiled plans to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/asia/china-renewable-energy-investment.html"">pump more than $360bn into renewable energy sources</a> by 2020.</p> <p>Finally, there is the question of soft power. With a climate denier now occupying the White House, some in Beijing see a golden opportunity to boost China’s global standing by spearheading the war on global warming.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/full-text-of-xi-jinping-keynote-at-the-world-economic-forum"">Xi’s speech at the World Economic Forum</a> - in which he urged the world to “meet the challenges of climate change” and praised the Paris climate deal as “a hard-won achievement” - suggests China may be preparing to do just that.</p> <p>“History,” the Chinese president told his audience to loud applause, “is created by the brave.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58817a09e4b0f0efb00f5fc6"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/calla-wahlquist""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:50:30.670Z"">2.50am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/heat-zip/giv-3902ty0KuGJAOMHW"" data-alt=""Fires""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/heat-zip/giv-3902ty0KuGJAOMHW"">Fires</a> </figure>  <p>Lightning struck bushland east of the coastal Victorian town of Wye River on 19 December, 2015.

As fire behaviour analyst Andy Ackland explained in the video below, the mapping system also predicts the occurrence of convection currents, where a blast of hot air pushes through the inversion layer of the atmosphere. That’s one of the key conditions of a firestorm.</p> <p>The system is used to inform public warnings and help firefighters prioritise when there are multiple fires on the same day (bushfires tend to come in crops of 12, Emergency Management commissioner Craig Lapsley said). It is also used in a strategic sense to figure out which power lines are most likely to cause devastating bushfires.<br>Ackland said it is increasingly used to map potential changes in bushfire risk caused by long-term climate change, which is drying out the mountain ash forests around Victoria and leaving them more prone to a severe bushfire.</p> <p>“Some of the most extreme fuel loads that you would see anywhere in the state are that type of mountain ash fuel,” Darrin McKenzie, deputy chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management said. </p> <p>Like many Australian trees, mountain ash has evolved to use fire to regenerate, shedding long ribbons of bark to create fuel. That strategy backfires in a catastrophic fire Black Saturday in February 2009, which burned hot enough to kill the mountain ash seeds and, with that, jeopardise the whole alpine ecosystem. </p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:52:19.458Z"">at 2.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588178c6e4b00b8fc2ae2972"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:41:47.689Z"">2.41am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>An interesting comment below the line.</p>  <figure class=""element element-comment"" data-canonical-url=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91535918"">  <div class=""d2-comment-embedded"" itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Comment""> <div class=""d2-left-col""> <a href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17231553"" title=""View slaine Lower’s profile""> <img class=""d2-avatar"" src=""https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/17231553"" height=""40"" width=""40"" alt=""User avatar for slaine Lower""> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-right-col""> <div itemscope itemprop=""author"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""> <a class=""d2-username"" href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17231553"" title=""View slaine Lower’s profile"" itemprop=""url""> <span itemprop=""givenName"">slaine Lower</span> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-permalink""> <a class=""d2-datetime"" href=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91535918"" title=""Link to this comment"" itemprop=""datePublished"">20 January 2017 2:01am</a> </div> <div class=""d2-body"" itemprop=""text""><p>What one comes away with from this and many of the comments here, is that it will be the China, unbelievable only a few years ago, that will be the global power leading sustainability.

Here’s something James has written for the blog today about the process of writing a book about the future of climate change, as that change was happening:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Back in 2012, when I began writing the book that would become Clade a lot of what I was writing was science fiction. Although there was no question climate change was an urgent problem, or that its effects were already being felt, most of the direr predictions still lay somewhere over the horizon. </p> <p>Yet as I wrote a peculiar and discomfiting thing began to occur. Events I was weaving into the fabric of the novel – the release of methane from the seafloor and the permafrost, mass die-offs of wildlife, the breakup of the Antarctic ice sheets, even changes in the Earth’s rotation due to the shifting weight of melting ice – started to move out of the pages of the book and into reality.</p> <p>The sense of hastening intensifies with every passing day. A decade ago it was possible to say the window for stopping dangerous climate change was closing, but that’s no longer true. If you live in the Pacific, or Africa, or many other parts of the world dangerous climate change is already here. The question is no longer whether we can avert dangerous climate change but whether we can avert a runaway climate catastrophe.</p> <p>There are days when I wonder whether continuing to believe that might be possible isn’t simply denial, a refusal to confront the truth. Speak to any scientist working in a field connected to climate change and you will quickly encounter a deep seam of despair. What is happening is occurring so quickly, so irrevocably it often seems overwhelming. </p> <p>Yet another part of me knows this sort of despair is self-fulfilling. Change doesn’t come from giving up, it comes from practical action and engagement. But it also requires hope, and hope requires we believe change is possible. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-588176eee4b01065cf5988e5"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/benjamin-haas""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:37:47.438Z"">2.37am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Hello from smoggy Hong Kong.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/laurelchor/status/822011519806238725"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">This the Hong Kong harbour, captured 6 hours apart.

The only reason we know is because of concerned community members sending in pictures to me and others saying: we think something’s going wrong but nobody else is interested. That took four, five, six months in 2015 from when it was first publicised.”</p> <p>“It’s now well over a year since the dieback started and still there is no dedicated surveys going on on the ground to establish what has gone on, the extent of it, and what we can do about it and what are the consequences, which are potentially enormous.”</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:49:49.126Z"">at 2.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588172b5e4b01065cf5988ca"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/eleanor-de-jong""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:28:39.730Z"">2.28am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>When <strong>Pubudu Senanayake</strong> cycles through the Christchurch CBD he feels a quiet sense of satisfaction that New Zealanders are adapting their island home of 4.5m to be more climate-friendly.

Except, all three are already happening in parts of southern India, and most acutely in Tamil Nadu.</p> <p>One of India’s wealthiest and best developed states, Tamil Nadu is nonetheless in the grip of its worst water shortage on record. This year’s monsoon brought less than half the usual rainfall. The reservoirs that supply Chennai, the capital, are at around 13% capacity – and the state still must weather six hot months before the monsoon rains returns in July. </p> <p>Rural areas already appear to already be in crisis: India’s human rights agency estimates <a href=""http://www.livemint.com/Politics/cnNqUn2yPyyD0eK2W2rcZI/NHRC-notice-to-Tamil-Nadu-on-growing-number-of-farmer-deaths.html"">at least 106 farmers</a> have killed themselves in the past month.</p>    <p>It isn’t all down to climate change. “The way Tamil Nadu is geographically rendered denies it access to precipitation,” says Jayshree Vencatesan, the managing trustee at the environmental group, Care Earth Trust. Mismanagement of crops and existing water resources also takes some share of the blame.</p> <p>But the annual monsoon season, the state’s lifeline, is bringing less rain than it used to. And when it does finally pour, the storms are intense and brutal, causing destructive floods of the kind that have <a href=""http://indianexpress.com/article/india/vardah-cyclone-tamil-nadu-chennai-how-chennai-took-on-vardah-4434202/"">ravaged Chennai</a> each December of the past two years, killing over 300 people.</p> <p>And though researchers are yet to study the link, Vencatesan says the state is “consistently warmer” than in the past. “You don’t really have a great seasonality. So, you have a monsoon, that’s followed by an intense summer – and there’s an immediate drying up of the system,” she says.</p>    <p>Tamil Nadu has been forced to beg surrounding states for help. In September, it won a legal battle with neighbouring Karnataka state for more access to water from the Cauvery, a river the two states share. But Karnataka too is desperately thirsty. The result was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/15/india-angry-clashes-karnataka-water-wars-run-deep-tamil-nadu"">days of anti-Tamil violence</a> in the streets of the Karnataka capital, Bangalore, including the torching of dozens of Tamil-owned vehicles and businesses. Demonstrators carried signs that read: “We will give blood, but not Cauvery.”</p> <p>Some unscrupulous water-tanker drivers have begun to exploit the situation. Vencatasan says hundreds are involved in buying water from farmers, and hauling it to villages where supplies are low. There they hock it for a steep markup. “They haven’t reached the point of forming cartels yet,” Vencatasan says. “But they are a water mafia.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58817106e4b00b8fc2ae2951"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:14:16.545Z"">2.14am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>We’ve collaborated with Tumblr to <a href=""https://globalwarning.tumblr.com/"">create a “quilt” of user-submitted messages and artwork</a> about climate change for this Global Warning project.

Managers told the Griffith researchers that assuming the need for climate change adaptation in its investments was a responsible “use of taxpayers’ money”.</p> <p>Other cases include the insurer Suncorp, which sees a growing cost of natural disasters in northern Australia in the form of cyclones, floods and hail storms as “the game changer and catalyst for change and action”.</p> <p>Over the last seven years in Queensland alone, insurers paid out $1.44 in claims for every $1 they collected in premiums, the study said.</p> <p>After Queensland’s costly 2011 floods, Suncorp assessed the cost of a levee to protect the flood-prone town of Roma at $11m – the same as it cost the government to provide emergency helicopter rescues for one flood.</p> <p>“This presented a very strong business case for the [Queensland] government to fund the levee, which they did,” the study said.</p> <p>Suncorp told the researchers that while the insurance industry has a “pretty good understanding of what the cost will look like”, this did not necessarily extend to the human costs, which are only apparent when disaster hits and insurers “turn up on the ground and start helping people rebuild their homes”.</p> <p>“At that point, it becomes evident that there is a range of risks and damages that are not ‘carried on anyone’s balance sheet’, for instance, mental health issues,” the study said. </p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:03:27.543Z"">at 2.03am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588169b8e4b0f0efb00f5f7e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T01:49:50.233Z"">1.49am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>AlexMourinho </strong>raises an interesting point: could the way forward from our changing climate be posed by philosophy?</p>  <figure class=""element element-comment"" data-canonical-url=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91534127"">  <div class=""d2-comment-embedded"" itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Comment""> <div class=""d2-left-col""> <a href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4603086"" title=""View AlexMourinho’s profile""> <img class=""d2-avatar"" src=""https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4603086"" height=""40"" width=""40"" alt=""User avatar for AlexMourinho""> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-right-col""> <div itemscope itemprop=""author"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""> <a class=""d2-username"" href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4603086"" title=""View AlexMourinho’s profile"" itemprop=""url""> <span itemprop=""givenName"">AlexMourinho</span> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-permalink""> <a class=""d2-datetime"" href=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91534127"" title=""Link to this comment"" itemprop=""datePublished"">20 January 2017 12:47am</a> </div> <div class=""d2-body"" itemprop=""text""><p>Philosophy in school.</p> <p>Mandatory.</p> <p>Thinking citizens is the only way out of this mess called civilisation.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>On the subject of science intersecting with philosophy, on Wednesday I went scuba-diving off the north shore of Sydney with <strong>Peter Godfrey-Smith,</strong> an academic philosopher who’s written a book about the consciousness of cephalopods.</p> <p>Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness is currently available in the US and due for release in the UK and Australia in February; Godfrey-Smith’s <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/opinion/sunday/octopuses-and-the-puzzle-of-aging.html"">New York Times column about octopuses and ageing</a> is a taster.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58816b4be4b01065cf5988ac"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/michael-safi""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T01:45:14.487Z"">1.45am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">    <p>Hello from Delhi, India’s heaving capital, where, inside government ministries, plans are being devised for the largest electricity rollout in history. India will need to supply power to nearly 600m new consumers by 2040, <a href=""https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2015/november/india-heading-for-the-centre-of-the-global-energy-stage-iea-says.html"">according to</a> the International Energy Agency. How they choose to do so matters to the entire planet.</p> <p>India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, takes climate change seriously. Extreme weather across the country, including droughts, storms, and the severest heat wave on record killed nearly 1,600 Indians, <a href=""http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-600-killed-due-to-extreme-weather-patterns-in-2016/story-ZXToWjowatrEYk81af2V4H.html"">it was reported this week</a>. Food yields are already estimated to have fallen by 6% because of higher temperatures – a phenomenon that might <a href=""http://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2016/08/08/climate-change-will-claim-160000-lives-year-india-2050/"">claim 160,000 Indian lives</a> each year by 2050.</p> <p>But Modi is also emphatic that climate change “is not of [India’s] making”. Historically, the country accounts for just 3% of the world’s total carbon emissions since 1890. India is unapologetic about <a href=""http://cprindia.org/sites/default/files/Modelling%20Studies%20Brief_FINAL.pdf"">potentially tripling</a> its coal use by 2030 if it means connecting every village to the grid and powering new schools, jobs and homes for hundreds of millions of its citizens.</p> <p>Averting a catastrophic increase in carbon emissions will come down to how much of that energy can be generated cleanly. India’s renewable energy target is hugely ambitious: an installed capacity of 175GW by 2022. To put that into perspective, the current capacity of India’s entire grid is around 310GW.</p> <p>So far, India <a href=""http://www.livemint.com/Industry/MyawHsvvqTE2IYIjCqj72O/Modi-govt-achieves-only-19-of-12000MW-solar-power-target.html?li_source=LI&amp;li_medium=news_rec"">doesn’t appear to be on track</a> to hit the 175GW target – but that’s missing the point. In pursuit of such a bold aim, it has already added nearly 15GW in renewable capacity, and attracted billions of dollars in investment. The southern state of Tamil Nadu is now the site of one of the world’s largest solar power plants. India’s total renewable capacity could increase by more than 50% <a href=""http://www.livemint.com/Industry/DaBUAGSAWbD4ObK5XxyxzJ/Indias-solar-capacity-may-double-to-18-GW-this-year.html"">in the next year alone</a>. It has already predicted <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/india-renewable-energy-paris-climate-summit-target"">it will exceed</a> its Paris targets by nearly 60% – and do so three years early.</p> <p>So, while the next posts will explore the threats posed by climate change to India, it’s worth remembering: there’s some cause for optimism, too.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T02:19:59.224Z"">at 2.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58816a04e4b01065cf5988a6"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T01:42:26.492Z"">1.42am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Lock the Gate is a large group of farmers and other citizens concerned about coal mining and gas extraction.

There is some confusion around this due to the changing amount of sea ice, and confusion between it and grounded ice. </p> <p>The area of sea ice is changing, due mainly to changes in the ocean currents and wind, moving the sea ice around and packing it together in areas. The ice on Antarctica (the so called grounded ice) is decreasing. </p> <p>Like any big land mass, things vary from area to area, but overall Antarctica is losing ice. We have several independent lines of evidence to support that. The most direct way is that satellites and aircraft (including the project I’m currently in Antarctica working on) measure the height of the surface of the ice sheet using lasers and radars. They show that many of the outlet glaciers and surrounding ice catchments are lowering, which can only happen if they are losing ice. The second way is that the gravitational field of the ice can be measured from space, we can “weigh the ice sheet” and it is weighing less over time. </p> <p>Again like any big area, things can change from year to year, but overall the pattern is that Antarctica is losing grounded ice, and especially the smaller (and therefore quicker to respond to any changes) West Antarctic region.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881611ce4b01065cf59887b"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/mike-bowers""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T01:04:52.058Z"">1.04am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/ocean-zip/giv-3902800Yz2zgGO4L"" data-alt=""Oceans""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/ocean-zip/giv-3902800Yz2zgGO4L"">Oceans</a> </figure>  <p>Kiribati: The 33 atolls and reef islands straddle the equator and are spread across an area of over 3 million square miles.

I think there is some evidence of older ice in Greenland than 123,000 years, but none that has been successfully recovered in an ice core, and more importantly dated. In general Greenland is much closer to the equator than Antarctica, and is more sensitive to warming air temperatures, so we think that during extended warm periods it would be a much smaller ice sheet and not extend to the coast like it currently does.</p> <p>When you drill an ice core, because of the way the ice had flowed over tens of thousands of years, the layers of ice that fell in any year get thinner and thinner, making it much more difficult to date the bottom of an ice core. In addition, the ice slowly moves so it can get folded up (think of the patterns your can see in rocks in road cuttings), and this disturbance in the ice at the bottom can make it very hard to use the very bottom of an ice core.</p> <p>Another factor for Greenland is that it is much smaller than Antarctica, so it just takes less time for the flowing ice to move to the edge and be lost to the ocean. So the ice gets replaced over much shorter timescales than in Antarctica.</p> <p>The geothermal energy question is good. In fact there is liquid water found at the base of Greenland in places, including the NEEM core which reached the folded ice from the last interglacial period. So yes, this is also a factor – mostly it is just a question of how long it takes for new snow to completely move to the bottom of the ice and get discharged at the edges.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trust

These move the sea ice around, and can cause it to build up in certain areas as it all gets pushed together. Once this happens, it can influence the ocean, for example waves get damped out by the sea ice, which stop them breaking up the sea ice. So it is more to do with the changes in ocean and wind patterns than temperature. </p> <p>There isn’t much direct coupling between the changes in the sea ice and ice on the continent. Most Antarctic sea is only one year old (although there are areas of so-called “multi-year sea ice”), while the ice on the continent is much older, tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The things that affect the ice on the continent are the amount of snow that falls to replenish it, the air temperature over summer for melting it, and how stable the ice shelves are that help hold back the glaciers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Keep your questions coming below the line.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-588156c3e4b0f0efb00f5f2c"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T00:21:45.795Z"">12.21am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>WWF Australia has jumped on the penguin awareness day bandwagon too, and included a some punny jokes in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wwfaustralia/photos/a.10150127451123712.331317.10113538711/10155735715263712/?type=3"">their Facebook post</a>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-embed"" data-alt=""WWF Australia Penguin Awareness Day post"">  <iframe src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwwfaustralia%2Fposts%2F10155735715263712%3A0&width=500"" width=""500"" height=""500"" style=""border:none;overflow:hidden"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" allowTransparency=""true""></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-588156a8e4b0f0efb00f5f2b"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T00:18:26.103Z"">12.18am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Jason Roberts </strong>of the Australian Antarctic Division has replied to <strong>CgGc13</strong>’s question below the line on the impact of the breaking up of the Lambert ice sheet.</p>  <figure class=""element element-comment"" data-canonical-url=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91531101"">  <div class=""d2-comment-embedded"" itemscope itemtype=""http://schema.org/Comment""> <div class=""d2-left-col""> <a href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17282144"" title=""View CgGc13’s profile""> <img class=""d2-avatar"" src=""https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/17282144"" height=""40"" width=""40"" alt=""User avatar for CgGc13""> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-right-col""> <div itemscope itemprop=""author"" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""> <a class=""d2-username"" href=""https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17282144"" title=""View CgGc13’s profile"" itemprop=""url""> <span itemprop=""givenName"">CgGc13</span> </a> </div> <div class=""d2-permalink""> <a class=""d2-datetime"" href=""https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/91531101"" title=""Link to this comment"" itemprop=""datePublished"">19 January 2017 11:12pm</a> </div> <div class=""d2-body"" itemprop=""text""><p>Questions for Jason Roberts when he comes on.

Parts of this ice shelf collapsed around 10 years ago, that time is just disintegrated, while this time in looks like calving a big iceberg. The previous collapse reduced the forces holding back the glaciers that feed this ice shelf, and the speed up (more than doubling their speed) in the following years, although I think the most recent studies are showing that they are starting to slow back down. We can probably expect similar behaviour when this shelf calves this time.</p> <p>On a global scale, the glaciers feeding the Larsen are fairly small and don’t contain a huge amount of ice. But their significance is more that they are the canary in the coal mine, showing us how vulnerable these ice shelves are to changes in the surrounding ocean. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58814ffce4b01065cf598829"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/elle-hunt""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T00:03:48.524Z"">12.03am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR 17: Answers from Antarctica</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Another hour has passed – here’s what we’ve covered:</p> <ul> <li>20 January being Penguin Awareness Day, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president?page=with:block-588144d2e4b01065cf5987e5#block-588144d2e4b01065cf5987e5"">we’ve duly raised your awareness</a> of penguins (let us know below the line if you’d like to be made more... aware)</li> <li>We heard how residents of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president?page=with:block-588146b5e4b01065cf5987ee#block-588146b5e4b01065cf5987ee"">Solomon islands are working to strengthen</a> forests, mangroves, reefs and other natural ecosystems that provide natural barriers to climate change</li> <li>How a seawall constructed in 1880 in Dunedin, in New Zealand’s South Island, has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president?page=with:block-58814c06e4b0f0efb00f5f01#block-58814c06e4b0f0efb00f5f01"">proved an inadequate barrier</a> given contemporary challenges</li> <li>The Australian Antarctic Division’s <strong>Jason Roberts</strong> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jan/19/global-warning-live-from-the-climate-change-frontline-as-trump-becomes-president?page=with:block-58814b41e4b0f0efb00f5efc#block-58814b41e4b0f0efb00f5efc"">on his daily flights out over Antarctica</a> – and what he sees</li> <li>And a selection of your thoughtful, interesting comments – please keep them coming!</li> </ul> <p>As Mikey mentioned, we’re about to hear from Jason for a real-time interview conducted – hopefully not-at-all haphazardly – between the Casey Station on Antarctica and the Guardian offices in Sydney.</p> <p>We’ve passed a selection of questions you’ve already left for him in the comments, but do send on some more.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881505ee4b01065cf59882e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T23:50:02.110Z"">11.50pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp"" data-alt=""Ice""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp"">Ice</a> </figure>  <p>As mentioned below, we have <strong>Jason Roberts</strong> on standby at Casey Station in Antarctica ready to answer your questions about his work (see previous post), about Antarctica, or anything else!</p> <p>Fire your questions at us in the comments below or tweet them to me at <a href=""https://twitter.com/MikeySlezak?"">@mikeyslezak</a>.

People are trying to think positively and adapt, because leaving our home is the worst-case scenario.”<br></p> <p>Former President and renowned climate change activist <strong>Anote Tong</strong> says when there is a king tide and a moderate westerly wind blowing there is frequent damage to villages and homes, with crops destroyed and fresh water wells tainted.</p> <p>During his time in office (which ended last year), Tong became famous in the climate change community for taking strong, preventative action to prepare his country for the worst, including building sea walls, buying “fall-back” land in Fiji if Kiribati residents were one day forced to migrate, and investigating the feasibility of building a floating island.</p> <p>Tong is adamant that the initial purchase of the land in Fiji was an “investment decision” but since Kiribati’s fate has become more dire, Tong says the Fijian government and its people have stepped forward with open arms.</p> <p>“I have never been in support of our people being given the status of climate refugees. And the reason I say that is we have more than enough time to prepare. And I have always advocated a policy of migration with dignity.” he says.</p> <p>“But the Fiji government and the people have come forward to say Fiji would welcome people from Tuvalu, and Kiribati, if they should ever need a place to go to. And I think that is the moral response that I have been looking for from the international community. So that should be put on record for someone acting in a humanitarian, moral way to a challenge that is going to mean the destruction of homes, culture and people.”</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T22:31:51.989Z"">at 10.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588138d7e4b00b8fc2ae2826"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T22:11:22.657Z"">10.11pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/action-zip/giv-3902R2F0QWyB3oxX"" data-alt=""Announcement""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/action-zip/giv-3902R2F0QWyB3oxX"">Announcement</a> </figure>  <p>Before we move on – a quick update for new readers about what we’re doing here.</p> <p>Just ahead of a climate sceptic moving into the White House, we’re producing 24 hours of reporting on climate change happening now.</p> <p>We began with the blog being piloted from London, and had reporting from Europe, Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>The reins were then taken over by our colleagues in the US, who delivered reporting from the Americas.</p> <p>And here we are now in Australia, bringing you reporting from everywhere between India and Kiribati.</p> <p>It’s not all doom and gloom – we have reports about communities fighting climate change, about reasons to be hopeful and posts about what you can do to help limit global warming.</p> <p>Keep checking back in and let us know what you’re thinking on twitter or below the line.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58813696e4b00b8fc2ae2814"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/michael-slezak""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T22:01:22.799Z"">10.01pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ/"" data-alt=""Announcement""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ/"">Announcement</a> </figure>  <p>Hello from Sydney, Australia.</p> <p>From the office here, we’re going to drive the blog for the next nine hours, taking it through to the 24 hour mark.</p> <p>As the sun is now moving over the Asia Pacific, we’ll bing you reporting from Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Australia, China, Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia, India and lots of places in between.</p> <p>We’ll also turn to Antarctica, and give you the opportunity to fire questions to a climate scientist who is there now, in the middle of a major research project.</p> <p>You’ll hear from people living on the frontlines of climate change around the region, as well as people at the frontline of the fight against climate change.

Is that true from what you have observed?</strong></p> <p>Indigenous lands and many Conservation Units (such as National Parks and National Forest) are the best protected areas. The indigenous peoples that are more protective are the ones that maintained their ancient livelihoods practices, which are dependent on healthy environment such as hunting, fishing and small scale agriculture. By being present in the areas, they also prevent timber extraction by loggers. Unfortunately, Congress wants to amend the constitution to make it harder to acknowledge land rights for indigenous people. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would review all demarcations of this type by Funai (The National Indian Foundation), which will further politicise the process.</p> <p><strong>What more could be done in Brazil?</strong></p> <p>INPE, the National Space Agency, uses satellite images to report the annual rate of deforestation and also to produce monthly alerts on hotspots of deforestation. Data from the latter – which is named DETER – is provided to the federal environmental agency to guide field inspections. Overall, the system works well, but in the past three years the government stopped publishing DETER’s data to the general public. The new Environment Minister has promised to resume monthly publication.</p> <p>The government should also resume the policies that had been effective including improving enforcement, implement and increase the area of Conservation Units. Additionally, government and private sector should work more on incentives for conservation, especially for small landholders. Finally, government should collect the land tax that would curb speculative deforestation and land grabbing.</p>    <p><strong>Looking 20 years into the future, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the Amazon?</strong></p> <p>The best scenario would combine the implementation of policies that have been effective with new ones, such as incentives for conservation, with the aim of keeping the existing forest. But it is also necessary to invest in restoration given that Brazil has an estimated 28 million hectares of legal forest deficit in the whole country – about half of that in the Amazon. However, Brazil has promised to reforest only 12 million hectares up to 2030 as part of the Paris Climate Agreement.</p> <p>The worst scenario would be the continuation of weak government and a private sector that fails to understand the importance of forest conservation to sustainable development and fails to execute their stated commitment to zero deforestation. In that case, deforestation and forest fires would continue and we could lose 30% by 2050. That would take the forest to turning point, after which it could lose the capacity to regenerate due a combination of drier climate and frequent forest fires.</p> <p><strong>Personally, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects for the Amazon?</strong></p> <p>I am very concerned because of the financial and political crises in Brazil that are likely to last for several years. To offset this, the private sector and the international community should increase their support for forest conservation. For example, large corporations that committed to zero-deforestation should work closely with Brazilian authorities and landholders to curb deforestation.</p>   </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T22:02:39.913Z"">at 10.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58812a41e4b0f0efb00f5e62"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/jonathanwatts""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T21:48:07.315Z"">9.48pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>The Amazon contains half the world’s remaining rainforest, with an estimated 390bn trees doing the work of storing carbon and regulating the climate. Deforestation is removing those natural air filters.</p> <p>Early this century, an area the size of Albania was being cleared every year. Since then, the good news is that Brazil, which contains 60% of the Amazon, has taken action to slow deforestation. But pressures on the forest are growing again. I asked <strong>Paulo Barreto</strong>, the head of Imazon, the leading independent Amazon monitoring organisation, to give me an update on the situation.<br></p> <p><strong>Your organisation uses satellite data to measure deforestation. What do the recent results tell us?</strong></p> <p>The rate of deforestation decreased nearly 80% from 2005 to 2012. But from 2012 to 2016, deforestation rates increased 75% going from 4,571 to 7,989 square kilometres. </p> <p><strong>Can you explain why progress has faltered? </strong></p> <p>Deforestation rates increased because after 2012 Congress and the government weakened the environmental laws by pardoning some of the illegal deforestation, reduced Conservation Units, built large infrastructure project without proper environmental licensing procedures and decreased the enforcement of environmental law.</p> <p><strong>An <a href=""http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/4/-16.33/-51.93/ALL/grayscale/loss,forestgain?tab=analysis-tab&amp;begin=2001-01-01&amp;end=2015-01-01&amp;threshold=30&amp;dont_analyze=true"">interactive map</a> by Global Forest Watch tracks the change in forest cover since 2001. It is impressively grim. The pink (decline) areas are far more prominent than the blue (increase) areas. What does this mean for the climate? </strong></p> <p>This means that the Amazon is a large contributor to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases when the forest is burned. In fact, deforestation is responsible for about half of the Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p><strong>Which areas have the most rapid deforestation ?</strong></p> <p>Cattle ranching accounts for 65% of the deforested areas in the Amazon. Deforestation is facilitated by large infrastructure projects, which facilitated transport and attract immigration. In the past five years, this has happened near Belo Monte dam in Altamira and along the BR-163 highway in eastern Pará State and near Porto Velho, Rondônia State, where two dams have been built. </p> <p><strong> On a more positive note, which areas are seeing reforestation ?</strong></p> <p>Most reforestation has been by natural regeneration of forests in abandoned pasturelands. Usually, these lands are in areas with poor potential for land use intensification such as riparian areas or zones with high rainfall.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58812b49e4b01065cf59875c"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T21:41:53.557Z"">9.41pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to “<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/26/investing/donald-trump-energy-plan/index.html?iid=EL"">save</a>” coal mining, holding rallies where he mimed shoveling and accused Barack Obama of doing “everything he can to kill the coal industry”. Surrounded by advisers who oppose climate regulations, Trump will soon be able to hack through the rules put in place by Obama to curtail pollution. Saving coal, however, is likely out of beyond his powers.</p> <p>The free market, far more than regulations, has done the work of killing coal. Despite Trump’s insistence that the US is struggling for energy, the natural gas industry has created a supply glut so significant it has cut deeply into the economies of entire nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia among them. </p> <p>Coal couldn’t compete.

Dr Michael Mann, currently a professor at Penn State, was sucked into a long-running legal suit when a rightwing activist group sued the University of Virginia, his former employer, to access tens of thousands of his emails. Scientists at the University of Arizona are currently <a href=""http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2016/06/22/az-court-reverses-protection-for-climate-scientists/"">enmeshed in a similar fight</a>, and last year representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2016/03/07/lamar_smith_broadens_his_attacks_on_noaa_scientists.html"">tried to subpoena scientists</a> at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Their argument is basically if you get the emails you’ll get the full meat of research, whereas it’s actually a way for them to take words out of context.”</p> <p>Barack Obama’s White House defended the climate scientists’ research; scientists now fear that the Trump administration will leave them at the mercy of lawmakers and activists with an interest in silencing scientists. In 2014 a court decided in Mann’s favor, agreeing with him that turning over research emails chilled research; discouraged collaboration; and put scientists at a competitive disadvantage. The Arizona case <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/07/climate-scientists-are-under-attack-from-frivolous-lawsuits"">remains unresolved </a>after a victory by a group funded by several energy companies. </p> <p>Scientists have also come to the legal group with fears for their professional future. They could be barred from grants or lose funding and effectively iced out of their own jobs, Kurtz said. “We worry about government suppression, where scientists can’t do the same research, can’t use the words climate change, modify reports to make it seem like it’s not as drastic as it is.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/15/climate-change-conference-agu-san-francisco-donald-trump"">Inside the largest Earth science event: 'The time has never been more urgent'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In turn, she said, the team of attorneys has started to research whistleblower cases, “if and when a scientist comes to us for those sorts of quandaries.

That person will also have a more difficult time fighting back against a sickness. Similarly, hotter and drier parts of the globe are more susceptible to wildfires and have a more difficult time responding to it. </p> <p>And scientists say the planet could become more vulnerable to wildfires.</p> <p>Fire season was longer for more than a quarter of the Earth’s surface from 1973 to 2013, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8537#affil-auth"">according to a July 2015 study published in Nature</a>.

Late in the campaign, Trump said he<a href=""http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/os-trump-in-sanford-20161025-story.html""> hoped to “free Nasa</a>” from its logistics work in low-Earth orbit (which Nasa does little of) and instead “refocus its mission on space exploration”.<br></p> <p>“Did you ever see what’s going on with space, with Russia and different places? And us? We’re, like, we’re like watching. Isn’t that nice? So much is learned from that, too.”</p> <p>The main suggestion of Trump’s speech, alongside his repeated denial and skepticism toward the science of global warming, is that he intends to cut Nasa’s Earth science work. Bob Walker, an adviser to the president-elect, has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/nasa-earth-donald-trump-eliminate-climate-change-research"">pushed the idea</a> of cutting all of Nasa’s climate research in favor of deep space exploration. Climate scientists have warned this would prove a savage blow to research efforts.</p>    <p>Trump’s nominee for secretary of commerce is billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who has not commented at all about how he would lead Noaa, protect US fisheries or guide climate science. Ross made his fortune, in part, by <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-wilbur-ross-commerce-secretary-20161129-story.html"">rehabilitating steel and coal companies</a>. Trump has not said who he would name Noaa’s administrator; Obama’s first pick for the post was marine ecologist Jane Lubchenco. The current administrator of Nasa, former astronaut Charles Bolden, is expected to follow tradition for appointees when a new president takes the White House, and submit his resignation shortly after Trump is inaugurated.</p> <p>Though Nasa has generally enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, it has a<a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/under-trump-nasa-may-turn-a-blind-eye-to-climate-change/""> $2bn Earth science program</a> that many scientists fear will suffer greatly under a Republican government stocked with many climate change skeptics and deniers.

But, because the world is so driven by economics and so driven by money right now, the only way you’re going to communicate to businesses is by starving their bottom line.</p> </blockquote> <p>Obiri-Darko added that such a change needed a combination of “people power” and government accountability; saying that one or the other alone would not bring it about. She said that, where she knocks on doors in south west London, air pollution was a major concern and only when climate change began to affect people would they start to demand action from their elected officials.</p>    <p>Raworth cited Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign as an example of what she characterised as an obsession with growth at the expense of other issues, such as the protection of the environment.</p> <p>Rowson agreed that Trump has an “old-fashioned economic mindset” and his election was unlikely to be helpful to those who sought to fight climate change. But he said, looking at the bigger picture, the election of a US president - possibly only for four years - should not been seen as a catastrophic event, adding that Trump can be influenced because of the extent to which he cares about his esteem.</p> <p>Bennett agreed that there was cause for optimism, arguing that movements have never brought about major societal changes unopposed.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>It was only when the campaigns to abolish slavery were doing really well that the pro-slavery movement formed.

But this ritual will become rarer and more expensive, according to forecasts that climate change will cut the bean-growing belt by half here and across the world over the next 35 years.</p> <p>Drought and rising average temperatures are already a growing worry for farmers such as Maria Assunção da Silva, whose family has grown coffee in Minas Gerais since the 19th century. </p> <p>The business has rarely been tougher than in the past four years. In 2013, the drought was so severe the beans formed as empty husks. Since then, he says, the weather has been destructively unpredictable. It has been dry in the usual rainy season, which results in smaller beans. In the usual dry season, it rains, which makes it difficult to process the harvest. </p> <p>“What we have been seeing in these past years has been hindering our production,” Silva says. </p> <p>Others have fared worse. In Espirito Santo recently, the worst drought in 80 years forced farmers to dig up thousands of arid robusta coffee trees and switch to alternative crops. Warehouses in the region were down to a quarter of their capacity. Exports of conilon, a variety of robusta, fell 90%. With prospects poor for this year, many warehouses are <a href=""http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/222578/drought-drains-brazil%E2%80%99s-warehouses-of-coffee"">expected to close</a>.</p> <p>Growers say the weather is becoming more erratic and extreme. São Paulo’s coffee producers suffered dire water shortages in 2015, but when the rains finally came, it was often in intense downpours that led to flood damage. While the main temperature trend is of warming, some crops were hit by frost in freakish cold spells last winter - in the middle of the hottest year ever recorded in the world. “What is certain is that the weather is more unstable and unpredictable,” noted agronomy engineer and coffee farmer, Pedro Ronca.</p> <p>Overall, improved production techniques and well-timed rains for the main arabica crop ensured a good national harvest and a stabilisation of prices. But scientists and environmental groups warn the situation will become more difficult in the years ahead in Brazil and other coffee-producing nations.</p>    <p>“Increasing temperatures and extreme weather events will cut the area (in the world) suitable for production by up to 50%, erode coffee quality, and increase coffee prices for consumers,” predicted <a href=""http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/verve/_resources/TCI_A_Brewing_Storm_FINAL_28082016_web.pdf"">a Climate Institute study</a> last year.</p> <p>Earlier <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270889201_Climate_Change_Impacts_on_Arabica_Coffee_in_Brazil "">research</a> by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, suggested none of the current coffee producing regions in Brazil would have the ideal conditions (average temperatures of 18-22C, ample rain and no frost) by 2080. “Once full climate change effects are experienced, Brazil may face challenges to remain a major coffee producing country,” the authors noted.</p> <p>This grim scenario is far from inevitable. As well as global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change, Brazilian officials, scientists and farmers are moving to adapt.</p> <p> Eduardo Assad, of the government’s agriculture <a href=""https://www.embrapa.br/equipe/-/empregado/242362/eduardo-delgado-assad"">research institute Embrapa</a>, believes there is considerable potential to move coffee production to the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. Currently that is not feasible due to frost, but this risk will decline if temperatures rise by 2C. </p> <p>Even so, this would require huge disruption to Brazil’s agriculture, particularly to coffee farmers who usually require 15 to 20 years for a return on their investment. For now, most would rather stay put and use technology and chemicals to cope with rising climate challenges. </p> <p>Silva is investing in a coffee drier because he cannot depend on the sun, more anti-fungicide chemicals because the risks from unseasonal rain have increased, and to counter the rising temperatures he is planting new heat-resistant varieties of coffee and insulating the soil with straw. </p> <p>“We don’t think the weather conditions will improve, so we are trying to adapt to the new climate variation,” he says.</p> <p>Such measures push up his costs and the global value of beans, but, if the forecasts are correct, it is only the start of the rise in price that we will all pay for our morning cup of coffee</p>   </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T20:27:24.460Z"">at 8.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588111c9e4b00b8fc2ae274b"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T20:00:55.289Z"">8.00pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR 13: drought from sea to sea</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>As <strong>Jonathan Watts</strong> reported earlier, the end of the world is looking not just warm but dry, from the mountainous lakes of South America up to the disappearing snowpacks of California.

Some of those homes – including the one I looked around in Brooklyn on Thursday – have solar panels on the roof, which means they can effectively be carbon zero.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3KqUGGu1_U""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U3KqUGGu1_U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T20:32:54.457Z"">at 8.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58810de8e4b01065cf5986cf"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T19:47:51.799Z"">7.47pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Since you’re here…</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>… We have a small favour to ask.

That is not a prophesy of doom, but an increasingly evident fact as I learned during a recent trip to Patagonia.</p> <p>I visited in October, revelling in the immensity of the region (which is four times the area of the United Kingdom), zagging back and forth between its Chilean and Argentinian sides, delighting in spectacular mountain and grassland scenery, and taking a dark pleasure in the road signs telling me I was on the “Ruta del Fin del Mundo”, a geographic reference to this southernmost tip of the Americas rather than a reminder of imminent apocalypse.</p> <p>I also spent a lot of time skimming stones across lakes - a childhood pastime given a fresh boost by the incredible scenery, the glasslike surface of tarns in the Torres del Paine, warm weather and the discovery of a slow-mo feature on my cellphone video camera. </p> <p>Much as I enjoyed this activity, it also reminded me of the damage being done by rising temperatures and declining rainfall. Lakes formed by glacier melt were full. Many others had dried up completely, destroying fish habitats and drinking sources for jaguars, guanacos and ema. This wasn’t restricted to Torres del Paine. Five hundred miles further further south, I saw pink flamingos flapping their way across a half empty body of water and, then, another 15 minutes along the road, a fox crossing through the dust of a white alkaline lake bed that had been completely exposed to the wind. Over the course of the weeklong trip, I lost count of the lakes that had evaporated.</p>    <p>After I returned home, I did a little research on whether this was merely seasonal or a sign of a longer-term climactic shift. </p> <p>Climate scientists believe the world’s extremities, the poles and mountains ranges, are <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.454.1290&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdfhttp://news.rutgers.edu/research-news/climate-change-affecting-high-altitude-regions-faster-rate-rutgers-study-finds/20150707#.WHu2wbYrJo4"">warming faster than elsewhere</a>, which means Patagonia is particularly vulnerable because both its latitude and altitude are high. </p> <p>Shin Sugiyama, a researcher at the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University, confirmed the region’s glaciers were declining faster than those in other mountain ranges. Andrés Rivera, a Senior Researcher of the Glaciology Laboratory at the Centre for Scientific Studies in Valdivia in Chile, noted how the recent dry period in the region has contributed to rising snow-lines and a loss of lake volumes. </p> <p>Eric Rignot, professor of Earth System Science at the University of California, said the glacier melt and lack of precipitation were likely to have been affected by the ebbing of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), a belt of Antarctic low pressure that normally brings snow and ice to Patagonia. Research from other scientists say SAM is at its weakest ebb in 1,000 years, due in part to to increasing greenhouse gas levels.</p>    <p>The consequences are not sudden. Rather they are of steadily increasing severity. Chilean newspapers have reported the worst drought in Patagonia since records began, after<a href=""http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/12/03/patagonia-ice-melts-chile-experiences-its-worst-drought-record""> seven consecutive years</a> of unusually low snowfall, short winters and hot summers. In Argentina, this is blamed for<a href=""http://en.mercopress.com/2016/09/28/argentina-lost-12-of-national-flock-to-severe-drought-in-north-patagonia""> the deaths of 1.8m sheep</a>, or 12% of the national flock. </p> <p>The earlier stage of this prolonged drought has also left a black mark on the landscape in the form of thousands of charred stumps from the huge forest fire that tore through Torres del Paine In 2011. That was started by careless tourists and spread out of control because trees and brush were unusually dry. </p> <p>Despite it all, Patagonia is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. I would certainly love to go back, explore remote glaciers, marvel at the other worldly skyscapes and, of course, skim more stones. How many lakes, though, will be left?</p>   </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T20:35:16.628Z"">at 8.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58810ae3e4b00b8fc2ae2719"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T19:00:10.695Z"">7.00pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR 12: who needs Washington?</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>As <strong>Lauren Gambino</strong> reported earlier, mayors in US cities are making plans to fight climate change themselves if they have to.

Daniel Neiditch, president of the Atelier and of real estate company <a href=""http://www.river2riverrealty.com/"">River 2 River Realty</a>, said that after rebates from the city and state, the investment cost $70,000.

He said developers “need to be educated” on the benefits – possibly by the city or state.</p> <p>The Atelier will be fitted with another 6,000 sq-ft of solar panels this summer, Neiditch said, which could mean solar accounts for 25% of the buildings electricity, saving $200,000 a year.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hTEjcxFeK0""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2hTEjcxFeK0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T20:35:29.895Z"">at 8.35pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5881048de4b0f0efb00f5da6"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/lauren-gambino""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T18:27:42.795Z"">6.27pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>This morning the Guardian caught up with a couple of big city mayors to discuss their concerns about the incoming administration’s climate change agenda.</p> <p>The takeaway: who needs Washington?</p> <p>Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Boston mayor Marty Walsh said the real change is happening at the local level and federal action, er inaction, won’t change that.</p> <p>“Don’t get in our way,” Garcetti said, describing his message to an administration that is hostile to efforts to curb climate change at the federal level.</p> <p>Trump has threatened to pull out of the international Paris agreement and said he would dismantle Obama’s Clean Power Plan, as well as other initiatives taken by the Environmental Protection Agency.

But will that actually happen?</p> <p>Currently, every functioning government in the world is signed up the Paris goal of limiting global warming to a 2C increase on pre-industrial times. Chinese president Xi Jingping, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/19/chinas-xi-jinping-says-world-must-implement-paris-climate-deal"">in a veiled jab at Trump this week</a>, warned that “we must ensure this endeavor is not derailed.” Similar diplomatic pressure is likely to come from other nations once Trump is in the White House.</p> <p>Quitting the Paris accord would take a three-year notice period. A quicker way would be to exit the UN climate body itself, which would take just a year. Such a move would likely cause other countries to question why they should make the effort to cut emissions if the US, historically the world’s largest emitter, can’t be bothered.</p> <p>The latter option appears unlikely, for now at least. Shortly after his election win, Trump said that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-change-open-mind"">he in fact has an “open mind”</a> to the Paris deal.

Is there is an ideological dividing line as in the US, or is there a broad consensus about the science?</em></p> <p>In 2015, 28% of Brazilian municipalities entered into emergency or calamity due to extreme weather – droughts, floods, storms, landslides. This affected millions of people so that are aware things are changing.</p> <p>We don’t face the same debate as the US about whether climate change is related to human activities. Last year, the Paris climate treaty was ratified easily despite our political crisis. Even the most conservative members on the political spectrum, the debate is more about what we do about climate change. Some say Brazil has already made the biggest contribution through deforestation reduction and renewables, which account for a little more than 70% of electricity generation and 40% of the total energy mix. The question is whether to do more. But unfortunately, climate change is not a priority for this government, as it wasn’t for the previous one. It is seen as an environmental issue, not a development issue.</p> <p><em>5) What does this mean in concrete terms?</em></p> <p>The past two years have seen a 60% rise in deforestation. Considering what is going on now in congress, we could see a new era of deforestation in Brazil. It is very alarming. We could be returning to the bad days of more than 10,000 square km of clearance each year.</p>    <p><em>6) How might climate policy be affected by the 2018 presidential election?</em></p> <p>I don’t think Brazil can elect someone like Trump who denies climate change, but we could have someone with very conservative ideas who sees the environment as an obstacle for development. They might argue that if US is doing nothing on climate, why should we? But one of the candidates will be former environment minister Marina Silva, who will ensure that sustainable development and climate policy are part of the debate. It’s too early though to say who might win. We don’t know who will run and what will be the impact of the ongoing corruption investigation (intro bribery at the state oil firm Petrobras). But the result will be important. The next president is the one who will have to deliver results because after 2020 Brazil’s commitments become obligations.</p> <p><em>7) Given the current trends, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future?</em></p> <p>I’m not too gloomy, but Brazil is a country of lost opportunities. Every year, there are more groups who see forests and the environment as obstacles to development. But there are good signs too. There is room in the private sector for discussing climate change as an opportunity for Brazil to benefit from our natural capital. We need a more efficient agriculture and more renewable energy – biofuels, bio energy, wind, solar and hydro. Why not make the most of these competitive advantages? The economic benefits of climate action are huge. We are trying to make this a priority for the next president. But it won’t be easy.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T17:45:11.152Z"">at 5.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880f45de4b00b8fc2ae2686"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/jonathanwatts""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T17:19:49.829Z"">5.19pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ/"" data-alt=""advice graphic""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ/"">advice graphic</a> </figure>  <p>If the world is to get emissions under control, Brazil will be a key player. Over the past decade, it has played a mostly positive role, both in taking domestic action to reduce the rate of deforestation of the Amazon, and also in constructive diplomacy in international climate talks. But economic recession and political turmoil have led many to fear this might change in the future. For an insight into what might come next, I approached <strong>Carlos Rittl</strong>, associate researcher of the Brazilian Climate Observator, an umbrella organisation that represents more than 40 environment NGOs. Here’s our Q&amp;A:</p> <p><em>1) Yesterday, the Brazilian justice ministry <a href=""http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1851036-ministro-da-justica-altera-demarcacao-de-terras-indigenas-no-pais.shtml?cmpid=twfolha"">changed the rules</a> for demarcating indigenous land. What is your take on this?</em><br></p> <p>This is really, really bad. It is the most negative change made in environmental and climate policy since the government of (Michel) Temer took power last year. Indigenous territories are critical for Brazil’s climate resilience. This new move threatens even already demarcated lands, yet the justice ministry moved ahead without any public debate, any discussion with the people affected. It shows what a myopic view the new government has when it comes to land use.</p>    <p><em>2) How else has climate policy changed since the switch of government from the centre-left administration of Dilma Rousseff to the centre-right administration of Michel Temer?</em><br></p> <p>In terms of Brazil’s goals, there has been no change. But there has been a shift in attitude that could affect whether those targets are achieved. There are many proposals that are bad for the climate. The administration wants to soften environmental legislation and reduce protected areas. Before Temer came to power, he outlined his approach in a document called Bridge to the Future. It contained no reference to climate or renewables. The only reference to the environment was a promise to weaken the environmental licensing process. </p> <p><em>3) One of the reasons for the political shift has been the rise of the agribusiness and evangelical lobbies in congress. What are their goals when it comes to climate policy?</em></p> <p>There is a danger that Brazil’s climate policy could shift backwards. Agribusiness presents itself as the solution to current economic crisis. They say they need more investment and more support and changes to land policy. The decision made by the ministry of justice yesterday is connected to that. They also want to prevent agribusinesses from having to do annual environmental licensing renewals. They want approval for mining in indigenous territories and protected areas. They are also pushing for more infrastructure to make their business easier. For example on the Tapajos river, they don’t just want more dams, but also waterways so soy can be shipped from central Brazil to Europe. All this will make it more difficult for Brazil to deliver on its 2020 climate goals. They are also trying to remove the environment minister from his post because he is trying to do his job.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T19:28:53.566Z"">at 7.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880f404e4b00b8fc2ae2680"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/markoliver""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T17:17:24.940Z"">5.17pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Over the next few hours we’ll also be hearing from our Latin American correspondent, Jonathan Watts.

Famously, Perry ran for president in 2012 only to call for the abolition of three government departments in a televised debate. The problem was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/rick-perry-forgets-agency-scrap"">he couldn’t remember the name of the third agency</a> – energy – leading him to flounder briefly and then mutter “oops”.</p>    <p><strong>Maria Cantwell</strong>, a Democratic senator on the energy committee, couldn’t resist: “I suspect now, having a chance to learn about the importance of this department, you have a very different opinion.” </p> <p>Perry conceded he may have been a little hasty. “After being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination,” he told the committee.</p> <p>The Department of Energy maintains America’s nuclear arsenal, cleans up nuclear waste and undertakes research in a number of areas, including climate change.</p> <p>The Trump transition team raised alarm by sending out a questionnaire that asked for names of scientists who have worked on climate research. Perry said he didn’t approve of the request and promised the committee that he wouldn’t target climate scientists or eviscerate their work.</p> <p>Perry did confirm, however, he supports Trump’s “America first” energy strategy (which means lots of drilling for oil and gas) and it doesn’t sound like he will be bending the president’s ear over the urgency of global warming. He told the committee:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by manmade activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>This sort of equivocation has become familiar during these confirmation hearings. Both <strong>Rex Tillerson</strong>, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and <strong>Scott Pruitt</strong>, his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, have said they accept the climate is changing but have voiced doubts over the extent of human culpability for this. </p> <p>Scientists, on the other hand, are <a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/"">pretty clear on this point</a> – the world is warming due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. </p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T16:20:22.028Z"">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880e274e4b01065cf5985a0"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/markoliver""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T16:03:31.017Z"">4.03pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR NINE: ominous signs for climate in Trump administration</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>We’ve picked up the climate blog in the US, and have heard from outgoing EPA boss Gina McCarthy<strong> </strong>who says staff there are nervous about the incoming administration’s attitude to science and climate change.

Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times over its pollution regulations, has questioned established climate science and has been criticized by environment groups for his ties to oil and gas interests.</p> <p>“People at the EPA will be respectful of the new administration but they will continue to do their jobs,” said McCarthy, who was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 to head the regulator. “I would not be telling the truth if I said there was no sense of nervousness.

But that conspiracy theory was expounded four years ago now and Trump’s attitude to climate change, like much else, has wobbled in the wind.</p> <p>Where once climate science was apparently just an excuse for a “very, very expensive form of tax”, Trump <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/donald-trump-paris-climate-deal-change-open-mind"">conceded</a> in November there may in fact be “some connectivity” between human activity and warming. On the campaign trail Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris climate deal but now Rex Tillerson, his choice for secretary of state, insists that the US will still have a “seat at the table” in climate talks.</p> <p>Climate change may be the defining challenge of our time, but the response of the world’s superpower remains clouded in doubt just a day before its new president takes power. Trump has been consistent, however, in his steadfast support for fossil fuels, even donning a miner’s helmet during a rally in West Virginia to promise – in the face of economic reality – that coal mining jobs will return.</p> <p>Environmental groups fear the worst – emissions reduction plans trashed, climate funding scrapped, scientists harassed or muzzled and a vacuum of international leadership that may encourage other countries to ease off their own efforts. </p> <p>Trump’s cabinet picks will be key and the signs are ominous. Incredibly, Tillerson, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant that actively suppressed its own knowledge of climate change for decades, may be the one most in line with mainstream science. Trump’s nominations for the Environmental Protection Agency and the department of interior, to name just two, have raised doubts over whether humans really are influencing the climate and have been showered in donations from polluters.</p> <p>We will look at each of these cabinet picks, as well as outline some of the key climate issues facing the Trump presidency. The next four years could well see havoc from severe storms, rising seas, scorching heatwaves and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Pertinently for Trump, these calamities could just as likely occur in the US as some far-flung country. Even his own resort at Mar-a-Lago in Florida <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/06/donald-trump-climate-change-florida-resort"">could be at risk</a>.

While the incoming president is dismissive of the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is real, serious and driven by human activity, the US population is not. A <a href=""http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-november-2016/3/"">survey in November</a> for the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 70% of Americans think climate change is real, and just over half, 55%, believe humans are mostly to blame. </p> <p>The figures are encouraging. But they make clear that the US public, like those in other countries, lags far behind the scientific opinion. The fact is that many people still don’t accept that climate change is driven by human activities, and that it is serious enough to warrant action.<br></p> <p>In the Guardian’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2017/jan/19/communicating-climate-change-a-psychoanalysis-science-weekly-podcast"">Science Weekly podcast</a> today, we explore why climate change risks can be hard for us to take on board. <a href=""http://cred.columbia.edu/about-cred/people/affiliated-researchers/debika-shome/"">Debika Shome</a> at the TCC Group co-authored a report for Columbia University on the psychology of climate change communication. She explains how the perception that global warming is a problem for people who live far away and far in the future, combines with scientific jargon and the inherent uncertainty around climate predictions to make climate change messages an exceptionally tough sell. But here, another field of science can help. Understand human psychology better, and the messages can be made to hit home, she says.<br></p>    <p>During the US presidential re-election campaign in 2012, <a href=""http://www.precisionstrategies.com/team/"">Matthew McGregor</a>, now at Precision Strategies in New York, ran Barack Obama’s digital rapid response team.

The climate change problem cannot be solved without help - and sometimes radical changes in behaviour - from businesses, large and small. But with little incentive to change their ways, what can we as consumers do to force corporations to act in the world’s best interests? As Bansal explains, it could be easier than you think. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5880c818e4b00b8fc2ae2555"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/damiancarrington""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T14:36:41.893Z"">2.36pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <h2>Ben van Beurden: ‘We don’t have to sacrifice economic growth’</h2> <p>Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell plc, now:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>It’s good news for all of us that [the Paris climate agreement] came into force. The scenarios that we and others have done clearly show that a future of net-zero emissions is technically feasible near the end of the century. And not only can the world achieve it technically, but it also makes economic sense in a societal way. In other words, we don’t have to sacrifice economic growth. That’s the good part.</p> <p>The remaining challenge is: can it be done commercially? Economically is about the way society can bear it, commercially is about how to make sure the main actors – consumers and companies – can, and will, do the right thing. And if society, through government, doesn’t ensure it makes commercial sense to move to a net-zero emissions energy system, nobody will make the next step.</p> <p>The good thing is that the Paris agreement raised the bar for everyone. Everybody feels the obligation to act. So in that sense I’m actually very optimistic.</p> <p>The nature of the challenge of climate change is that it will require unprecedented levels of co-operation between government, industry and society. What often tends to happen in our industry is that you have either isolated advocacy, or people have a very adversarial approach: I’m for, you’re against. In the end this doesn’t resolve anything. It just creates noise for policymakers. We have to move beyond that and start real collective planning for how we are going to achieve the kind of energy transition the world needs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5880c7e5e4b01065cf5984d5"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T14:33:10.548Z"">2.33pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <h2>Craig Bennett: This is ‘decade zero’</h2> <p>Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, talks to Damian ...</p> <p>What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change?</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The climate impacts of global temperature rises of just 1C have already triggered melting ice-caps, unleashed killer storms and droughts, bleached the world’s coral reefs, choked our cities with pollution and displaced people from their homes. The case for urgent action is now universally accepted by governments, scientists, business and ordinary citizens around the world.</p> <p>Whilst trillions of dollars are being invested in the renewable energy sector and building a low carbon economy, this is still too little and too slow. This is ‘decade zero’: The decisions we make now on meeting our energy needs, producing our food and protecting our forests will determine if we can keep temperature rises well below 2C and prevent catastrophic climate change. We’re sitting in the last chance saloon but governments still seem unable to break their addiction to dirty energy – unless people power can make them.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is your message to President Donald Trump?</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Renewable energy and the low carbon economy is the world’s greatest job creator.

This involves switching to clean forms of electricity, transport, cooling and heating, and finding ways to avoid – or mop up – emissions from industry, agriculture, shipping and air travel.

Relentless growth in global CO2 emissions has been brought to a halt much earlier than anyone thought possible. Wind and solar power have become the cheapest new power sources in much of the world; natural gas is outcompeting carbon-intensive coal; LEDs and other energy efficiency solutions are being installed at scale; and electric vehicles are starting to fly out of showrooms.</p> <p>But it’s not enough to stabilise emissions: to stay within a 2C carbon budget we have to see emissions cut dramatically and quickly, which remains a staggering challenge. The Paris agreement set out ambitious long-term aspirations, but its near-term commitments don’t add up to much. In particular, if Asian countries build all the coal-fired power stations currently in their plans, then kiss goodbye to the 2C warming target.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is your message to President Donald Trump?</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America Great Again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is the best action concerned citizens can take?</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Focus on a few big things. If you are renovating, insist on lots of insulation, good windows, a good boiler and efficient appliances. You can cut your fuel bills by 75% – I know because I’ve done it. If you live in a city, get rid of your car: join a car club, walk or cycle more, use cabs and public transport. Again, I know because I haven’t owned a car in London for 22 years.

The world is upside down really. The old developed world has more or less lost faith in saving the planet and it is the new economies who seem to take the lead. This is the hope we have.</p> <p>Politicians can’t do it on their own. The political process is so slow and dysfunctional almost everywhere. There are two factors that can accelerate our transition to sustainability. One is clearly technological progress, which is often much faster than anybody expects. The other is civil society, you have to put pressure on your politicians. You have to raise the moral bar much higher. You have ask them ‘do we want to save this planet for our descendents or not?</p> </blockquote>    <p>On the actions concerned individuals can take, Schellnhuber said three things stick out:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Try to avoid using airplanes. Whenever you do a carbon balance sheet, you see flying is just the worst thing you can do regarding your carbon footprint and often it is more convenient to take a train these days. Second is to reduce your meat consumption, if you eat any, and that is also good for your health.</p> <p>The third one is follow the money: the fossil fuel divestment movement. Tell your bank manager you would like your money be invested into renewables instead of coal, oil and gas industry. At least become a pain in the neck.

That is extremely important and quite extraordinary when you think how difficult it is to put together a global agenda with 196 countries.</p> </blockquote>    <p>But he said it was openly acknowledged that the Paris deal leaves a big gap between the current plans and what is needed to avoid 2C of global warming - the danger limit agreed by the world’s nations.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The next very big question is how do we ramp up those ambitions. China, the biggest emitter, is ahead of the game. It said it would peak [its carbon emissions] by 2030, but my guess is it will peak not very long after 2020. That is the key example. I have been working in China for 30 years and the change over the last six to seven is quite remarkable.</p> <p>India is starting to get much more committed too. So if you look at the two countries with the biggest populations, you do see changes. But the US and Europe will matter greatly to this. It is very important Europe raises its game.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stern said Donald Trump needs to back the green economy to take advantage of the growing global demand for clean energy, which is being driven by the worldwide commitment to tackling global warming.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stern said concerned individuals should put pressure on governments and businesses:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Demand explicitly and directly strong action from the politicians, particularly in cities where we know action can be extremely rapid.

More coastal erosion and threat to sea life I’m guessing, but are there other things happening?

This is from a <a href=""http://www.oceanacidification.org.uk/"">UK research programme</a>: “Already ocean pH has decreased by about 30% and if we continue emitting CO2 at the same rate by 2100 ocean acidity will increase by about 150%, a rate that has not been experienced for at least 400,000 years. Such a monumental alteration in basic ocean chemistry is likely to have wide implications for ocean life, especially for those organisms that require calcium carbonate to build shells or skeletons.” </p> <p>I think acidification is unlikely to affect salinity or coastal erosion.

The cost of conventional nuclear power has not, but so-called <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/24/mini-nuclear-reactors-answer-to-climate-change-crisis"">“small modular reactors” (SMR) are now attracting a lot of attention</a>: smaller, cheaper and mass produced is the promise.<br></p> <p>An <a href=""http://newsroom.nuscalepower.com/press-release/company/nuscale-submits-first-ever-small-modular-reactor-design-certification-applicat"">SMR design was recently submitted to regulators</a> in the US, but Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, is not holding his breath. “I do laugh when people talk about SMRs being five years around the corner. The licensing conditions for nuclear – quite correctly – imply a very slow development process because you can’t mess around with it.”</p> <p>The great hope for nuclear for decades has been nuclear fusion, which carries the prospect of cleaner and limitless energy. However, even those building the biggest fusion experiment in the world – <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/02/after-60-years-is-nuclear-fusion-finally-poised-to-deliver"">ITER in France</a> – acknowledge that commercial nuclear fusion will not come before 2050, by which time global emissions will already have to be near zero.</p> <p>Much faster to deliver will be smart grids, which <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/11/energy-first-as-uk-successfully-transmits-data-via-national-electricity-grid"">apply data and communication software</a> to make far more efficient use of existing electricity, creating in effect “virtual power stations”.

From solar air ships to lab-grown meat, algae jet fuel to nuclear fusion, technology innovations around the world hold the hope of slashing carbon emissions and giving a big boost to the battle against global warming.</p> <p><a href=""http://mission-innovation.net/"">Mission Innovation</a>, a collaboration involving 50 of the world’s biggest nations, is set to invest $30bn a year by 2020 on clean technology, and the UK’s special representative for climate change, Sir David King, played a leading role in its creation. One of his favourites is a huge new airship being developed by a British company, <a href=""http://www.varialift.com/"">VariaLift</a>, to provide low-carbon freight transport.</p> <p>The plan is to cover the airships with photovoltaics, then rise them to 50,000 feet where there is very little air resistance. Solar energy can then power the electrical engines and the airship could reach speeds of 340km/h.</p>    <p>Also attracting attention is a German idea to store energy in regions without mountains, where pumped-water storage cannot be used. <a href=""http://www.heindl-energy.com/"">Heindl Energy</a>’s solution is to raise a giant column of rock using the pumped water, which is then allowed to fall again when the energy is needed.</p> <p>The allure of new technology is strong, not only to speed up cuts in emissions, but also because of the colossal market it represents, offering good jobs and economic growth.

Built in eight years, its six gates have never failed to protect London.<br></p> <p>In the early hours of last Saturday morning, Steve East made a judgment call to protect Londoners from the Thames. Faced with tidal and weather forecasts and other data, the engineering manager of the Thames Barrier decided to raise it for the second occasion in 2017 and the 178th time since it was finished in 1982.</p> <p>The result was a 3.3 metre differential – the height of the water level on the downstream side, which leads out to the North Sea, above the upstream side of central and west London, which the huge structure protects.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ctB1cuBxww""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ctB1cuBxww?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>“It’s an art, not a science because we are making decisions on forecasts,” he tells me, as we overlook the barrier where the rotating gates are raised in times of need. East started working as an administrator at the barrier 31 years ago. Over that he time, he’s not seen a linear line showing the barrier being closed more frequently, but a more jagged line with spikes in individual years.</p> <p>For example, in one recent year the barrier was closed on 50 occasions in just a three month period. Before that it had gone about two years without a closure. “It’s an easy decision to close it. The hard decision is not to close it,” he says. While closure protects Londoners and property from flooding, it also stops river traffic, wildlife such as seals, and puts a “strain on the asset”, as East puts it, wearing the barrier out.</p> <p>The barrier should last until about 2070. Climate change means a 20-90cm sea level rise in the Thames by 2100, according to the Met Office and Defra, and East is clear: “There’s an acknowledgment that sea level rise will require a new barrier.” </p> <p>Planning is just beginning on what location and size that barrier might take, but the project is anticipated to cost £10bn. Some of that money will go on raising and strengthening the tidal walls downstream of the barrier, and making space for water downstream to overflow into during tidal surges, such as car parks and playgrounds.</p> <p>East thinks that when the barrier starts having 50 closures a year regularly – at the moment the average is four annually – that’s when a new barrier will be needed. But for now – even with the two closures in less than a month this year – “we’re a long way from that”.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:27:00.260Z"">at 12.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880ac08e4b00b8fc2ae24aa"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/ruth-michaelson""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:14:36.953Z"">12.14pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe"" data-alt=""drought""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe"">drought</a> </figure>  <p>Across the Middle East and north Africa, global warming means record temperatures, which in the summer can make life unbearable from Tehran to Tripoli.</p> <p>The knock-on impact on farming in the region has been severe – indeed some people have even blamed the Arab spring partly on the way climate change has depleted agriculture. </p> <p>But some enterprising farmers are finding ways to beat the drought, like this Egyptian extolling the virtues of hydroponic farming – that uses more than 95% less water by not planting in soil.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTKuOvoIXsU""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTKuOvoIXsU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:19:48.141Z"">at 12.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880a62ae4b01065cf5983ca"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/emilywilson""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:04:39.545Z"">12.04pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>A final three tips on positive individual action here from <a href=""https://www.carboncommentary.com/"">Chris Goodall</a>:</p> <p><strong>•</strong> For a decade, investors ignored the movement that advocated the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. Large fuel companies and electricity generation businesses were able to raise the many billions of new finance they needed. Now, by contrast, money managers are increasingly wary of backing the investment plans of oil companies and switching to renewable projects. And universities and activist investors around the world are selling their holdings in fossil fuels, making it more difficult for these companies to raise new money. Vocal support for those <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-double-5tn-in-a-year"">backing out of oil, gas and coal</a> helps keep up the pressure.</p> <p><strong>•</strong> Politicians tend to do what their electorates want. The last major UK government survey showed that 82% of people supported the use of solar power, with only 4% opposed. A similar survey in the US showed an even larger percentage in favour. The levels of support for onshore wind aren’t much lower, either in the US or the UK. We need to actively communicate these high levels of approval to our representatives and point out that fossil fuel use is far less politically popular.</p>    <p><strong>•</strong> Buy gas and electricity from retailers who sell renewable power. This helps grow their businesses and improves their ability to provide cost-competitive fuels to us. Renewable natural gas is just coming on to the market in reasonable quantities in many countries and fossil-free electricity is widely available. Think about switching to a supplier that is working to provide 100% <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/28/record-46-of-uks-electricity-generated-by-clean-energy-sources-in-2015"">clean energy</a>.</p> <p>Chris’s 15 things you can do to help stop manmade climate change is published in full <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/how-to-reduce-carbon-footprint"">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:06:41.048Z"">at 12.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880a618e4b01065cf5983c9"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/mark-rice-oxley""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T12:00:39.555Z"">12.00pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">HOUR FIVE: reasons to be (cautiously) cheerful</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Have we really been going five hours?

If the top 10 high emitters – people like you and me and others – if we reduce our carbon footprint just to the level of the average European it would be a one-third cut in global emissions.</p> <p>“I genuinely think we could achieve it in one year but we would have to think that climate change is a very serious issue and that has big political implications.”</p>    <p>Anderson, who already avoids flying where he can, made his comments in the run up to a talk he will give on 9 March at Cambridge University.</p> <p>This is part of a new town and gown initiative, the <a href=""http://www.climate-series.eng.cam.ac.uk"">Cambridge Climate Lecture Series</a>, designed to rekindle more debate on global warming.</p> <p>Anderson is convinced that wealthy westerners must act decisively and radically to change their lifestyles.</p> <p>“Those of us who are high emitters … need to rapidly curtail how often we fly. We should not be flying on any occasion business class or first class because that has far higher emissions. We need to find alternatives to flying.</p> <p>“But in addition, we need to make sure that we are not living in larger houses and have many houses, and drive larger cars.</p> <p>“Our high incomes allow us to have status in society and typically have larger carbon footprints. It is a real challenge for us in that position because we have to significantly change in the short-term our lives and find other ways of seeing value for hard work.”</p> <p>Anderson plans to use his talk to explain what kind of personal, societal and corporate changes need to be made in Britain to meet the UK government’s commitment under the Paris climate change agreement.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T11:52:07.438Z"">at 11.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880a14de4b01065cf5983a2"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/sune-engel-rasmussen""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T11:30:52.272Z"">11.30am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp/"" data-alt=""snow""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/snow-zip/giv-3902FTKxwPRtwkYp/"">snow</a> </figure>  <p>Afghanistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – but some people are trying to make a difference.</p> <p>An estimated 80% of Afghanistan’s natural resources have been destroyed over four decades of conflict, Ahmad Seyer, director of the Rural Green Environmental Organisation (RGEO) and one of the few Afghan charities working to mitigate the effects of climate change, has told me.<br></p>    <p>Seyer, a civil engineer by training, worked to protect the environment since the mid-1990s, during the Taliban regime, when he worked with international agencies. But it was not until three years ago that he really became aware of the problems associated with climate change. Since then, climate change has been an integral part of the environment awareness training his organisation provides to mosques and schools.<br></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p> In most villages where I go, they actually understand.

Only three percent of Afghanistan’s surface is covered by forests. Loggers and people in need of wood to burn during winter threaten what is left.<br></p> <p>RGEO has reforested 200,000 trees to help absorb greenhouse gases and provide protection for communities during flash floods, which hit Badakhshan almost every year. Last year, following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake, <a href=""https://centralasiainstitute.org/flood-relief-badakhshan-victims/"">a flood destroyed over 800 homes</a> in the province.</p> <p>However, while a more sustainable environment would help boost livelihoods in the long term, for many families, economic concerns, compounded by war and unemployment, are more immediate.<br></p> <p>Farmers have had to sell livestock to survive.

It now runs on about $100,000 over the next couple of years, about half of which is provided by the United Nations Development Program.</p> <p>Faced with the task of convincing fellow Afghans, living in dire conditions, to care about the environment, Seyer said he was dismayed to see the incoming American president scoff at climate change.</p> <p>“This is not a joke.

For obvious reasons most of these tips (again from Chris Goodall) focus on what wealthier citizens (which includes most westerners) can do. Here are three:</p> <p><strong>•</strong> The CO2 impact of goods and services is often strikingly different from what you’d expect. Mike Berners-Lee’s book <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/jul/01/carbon-footprint-banana"">How Bad Are Bananas?</a> takes an entertaining and well-informed look at what really matters. Bananas, for example, are fine because they are shipped by sea. But <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/aug/12/seasonal-eating-vegetables-uk-does-it-matter"">organic asparagus</a> flown in from Peru is much more of a problem.</p> <p><strong>•</strong> Invest in your own sources of renewable energy. Putting solar panels on the roof still usually makes financial sense, even after most countries have ceased to subsidise installation. Or buy shares in new cooperatively owned wind, solar or hydroelectric plants that are looking for finance. The financial returns won’t be huge – perhaps 5% a year in the UK, for example – but the income is far better than leaving your money in a bank.</p>    <p><strong>•</strong> Buy from companies that support the switch to a low-carbon future. An increasing number of businesses are committed to 100% renewable energy. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/12/climate-survey-change-conference-unilever-tesla-united-nations"">Unilever</a>, the global consumer goods business, says its operations will be better than carbon-neutral by 2030. Those of us concerned about climate change should buy from businesses acting most aggressively to reduce their climate impact. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-58809baae4b01065cf598377"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/emilywilson""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T11:13:14.756Z"">11.13am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Over the next hour we’re going to try to focus on the positive. We’ll look more at what we can all do as individuals, and at inspirational work both locally and internationally to combat manmade climate change.</p> <p>It’s really easy to feel despairing and overwhelmed about climate change. Personally I found this piece by Chris Goodall today to be both inspiring and cheering. He writes about how he used to believe that only massive government subsidies would make clean energy a success, which basically meant it would be a failure. Now he admits he was “completely wrong” about that, and argues that the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified, because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem.

In the worst case scenario – which would see global temperatures rising by nearly 5C by the end of the century – deserts would expand northwards across southern Spain and Sicily, and deciduous forests would be replaced by Mediterranean vegetation. Roughly a third of Spain would find itself as arid by then as the <a>Tabernas desert</a> in Almería is today.</p> <p>As one ecologist has pointed out, a rise of nearly 5C would be <a href=""http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/11/01/inenglish/1478001033_278617.html"">“like bringing Casablanca to Madrid”</a>.</p>    <p>This warming has implications for the Alps too. The Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner, says that in the Italian resort of Obereggen, sometimes it has not been cold enough to give the town much time to crank up its snow production.</p> <p>Resident Thomas Ondertoller told her:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Last year we had one week to make the snow. We use a lot of water, and a lot of technical expertise, to make as much snow as possible, because usually after that there is a warm period.</p> <p>For the passionate skier, the product is perfect. For the romantic skier, something is missing,” he says.</p> </blockquote> <p>Further north, it is the sea, not the snow that is the problem, Jennifer Rankin reports from Belgium.</p> <p>Authorities in Flanders, guardians of Belgium’s 73km strip of coastline, are spending €8m (£6.9m) to investigate whether they can build an island to keep the rising tide at bay. The newest bit of Belgium would be off the coast of Knokke, the genteel resort best known for its picturesque dunes and posh golf course. Under an early plan, the island would be 40 hectares big, but could be made 10 times larger over time.</p> <p>Across the border, the Dutch have built the world’s biggest storm barrier, near Rotterdam. The Maeslant barrier – two enormous steel gates almost as long as the Eiffel tower – is designed to protect the port city and the rest of southern Holland from a once in a 10,000-year storm.</p> <p>Peter Persoon, an engineer-turned-tour guide, said:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p> What we tell the people here in the Netherlands is, if the country is flooded the damage will be at least €700bn.</p> <p>If you instead spend every year one billion euros, you spread the bill over 700 years.

For the future, it is yet to be seen,” he said.</p>    <p>There has been another change related to climate that is sure to have a bigger impact: harvests in Chianti are now happening earlier than in the past. The harvest period used to be around 1 October, he said, but now it is happening between 1-15 September, often because of heatwaves. These are occurring with greater frequency and intensity in the summer months, leading to a faster maturation of the grapes.</p> <p> It means that in the future, in a decade to three decades from now, grapes in the Chianti region may require irrigation, which is not required now.<br></p> <p>“If we look to the models, with the projected increases in temperature, there will be a water shortage and probably in the future – 10 or 20 or 30 years – we should require some irrigation for grapes. It means we should have some reservoirs of water,” he said.</p> <p>Maracchi said the issue is not necessarily at the top of farmers’ minds, though it should be.</p> <p>“You know, up until the time comes that they can see some effect from the economic point of view, they are not concerned,” he said. “They should be, in my opinion, because climate change is a general problem and we [will] have a lot of trouble.”</p> <p>It is not just an Italian phenomenon. In its <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/20/global-wine-production-falls-2016-climatic-events"">2016 global wine output estimate</a>, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine last year said it expected global wine production to drop by about 5% due to “climatic events”, causing steep drops in production in Chile and Argentina.</p> <p>While the group did not point a finger of blame at climate change specifically, it suggested that global warming, coupled with natural climate variability, were causing a profound change in the wine business, and had made 2016 one of the worst wine production periods in the past two decades.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-588093d9e4b0f0efb00f5a89"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/jennifer-rankin""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T10:41:44.491Z"">10.41am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe/"" data-alt=""heat""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe/"">heat</a> </figure>  <p>The other issue that looms for Europe is that of climate refugees. War and persecution have forced more people to flee their homes than at any time since records began.

The majority fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa go to neighbouring countries or regions; most victims of extreme weather live in Asia.<br></p>    <p>Nevertheless, European Union policymakers, struggling to cope with large numbers of recently-arrived migrants, are aware that climate refugees could be on their doorstep.</p> <p>This week the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, told the Guardian:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p> Europe is also surrounded by regions that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and we can definitely not afford to ignore the links between climate change and migration.</p> </blockquote> <p>He is careful about drawing links between climate change and migration, saying that climate change can multiply instability, conflict and state fragility, prompting people to leave their homes.<br></p> <p>Statistics are difficult to pin down, partly because of the role environmental degradation plays in fuelling conflict. Scientists have said a devastating drought in Syria between 2006-2010 – and the weak response of Bashar al-Assad’s government – was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/02/global-warming-worsened-syria-drought-study"">a contributory factor to the ongoing conflict</a>.<br></p> <p>British economist, Nicholas Stern, has estimated that up to 200 million people could be displaced by climate change by 2050. But not all will end up in safer places. People leaving desertified villages can move to towns lying on a flood-plain. Some will not afford to be able to move: natural disasters that impoverish communities make it harder for people to start again somewhere else.<br></p> <p>This means climate change is also likely to put more pressure on the EU’s humanitarian aid budget, worth €1.27bn (£1.1bn) in 2014. Stylianides says the EU is spending more on reducing the risk of disasters. But only 13% of EU aid is spent on prevention, while the demand for urgent humanitarian help is growing.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T10:42:36.746Z"">at 10.42am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58809474e4b01065cf598339"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/emilywilson""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T10:29:48.087Z"">10.29am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>The Guardian has published a leader article on Trump and climate change today.</p> <p>It makes the point that while Trump may be able to wreak a lot of damage on the climate front, it’s not all going to be up to him:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>There’s no doubt the world will lose out if America decides to relinquish global leadership on battling climate change.

Scientists expect that to worsen dramatically as rising temperatures dry out peatland in rain-starved areas, and extreme weather events increase, without concerted effort to protect and conserve them.

If you have any energy-guzzling halogen lights in your house – many people have them in kitchens and bathrooms – it makes good financial and carbon sense to replace as many as possible with their LED equivalents. They should last at least 10 years, meaning you avoid the hassle of buying new halogen bulbs every few months. Not only will your CO2 footprint fall, but because LEDs are so efficient, you will also help reduce the need for national grids to turn on the most expensive and polluting power stations at peak demand times on winter evenings.<br></li> <li>Frequent use of a tumble dryer will add to your energy bill to an extent that may surprise you. But when buying a new appliance, don’t assume you will benefit financially from buying the one with the lowest level of energy consumption. There’s often a surprising premium to really efficient fridges or washing machines.</li> </ul>    <ul> <li>Consume less. Simply buying less stuff is a good route to lower emissions. A new woollen man’s suit may have a carbon impact equivalent to your home’s electricity use for a month. A single T-shirt may have caused emissions equal to two or three days’ typical power consumption. Buying fewer and better things has an important role to play.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T09:54:11.940Z"">at 9.54am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-58808802e4b00b8fc2ae23a1"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/damiancarrington""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T09:49:37.236Z"">9.49am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/floods-zip/giv-3902MEOLJGWGO4p4"" data-alt=""icon""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/floods-zip/giv-3902MEOLJGWGO4p4"">icon</a> </figure>  <p>Turning our attention to the UK, climate change is already affecting parts of Britain, principally by increasing the risk of extreme flooding and heatwaves, and on Wednesday the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017"">government accepted</a> almost all of the current and future risks set out by its official advisors, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC).</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/uk-poorly-prepared-for-climate-change-impacts-government-advisers-warn"">CCC’s report, published in July,</a> concluded the UK was poorly prepared for global warming and set out six priority risk areas. The first two were rated as high risk now, with more action needed.</p> <ul> <li>Flooding already causes £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C.<br></li> <li>The <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4259-european-heatwave-caused-35000-deaths/"">deadly heatwave of 2003</a>, which peaked at 38.5C in the UK, will be a normal summer by the 2040s, leading to heat-related deaths more than tripling. There are currently no policies to ensure homes, schools, hospitals and offices remain tolerable in high heat.<br></li> <li>Severe water shortages are expected as summers get drier and, by the 2050s, will extend across the UK. If temperatures are driven up significantly, many places in the UK will have a demand for water 2.5 times greater than that available.<br></li> <li><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange"">Climate change</a> is likely to drive food prices up, with extreme weather leading to lost crops and price shocks. About 40% of UK food is imported, making the UK vulnerable to droughts and floods driven by climate change around the world.<br></li> <li>The proportion of prime farmland is expected to fall from 38% to 9% with significant warming, and crop growing in eastern England and Scotland could be ended by degraded soil and water shortages. Warming seas are pushing key species northwards, which may affect the entire marine food chain.<br></li> <li>New dangers may invade the UK as the climate gets warmer and requires urgent research. “The impacts are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants,” the report states. “Higher temperatures will lead to an increased risk of the Asian tiger mosquito, the vector of Chikungunya virus, dengue fever and Zika virus. The current risk remains low, but may increase in the future.”<br></li> </ul>    <p>The CCC also warned that climate-stoked wars and migration around the world could have very significant consequences for the UK, through disrupted trade and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/10/climate-change-will-see-more-uk-forces-deployed-in-conflicts-around-world"">more military intervention</a> overseas.<br></p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/climate-change-challenges-set-out-in-new-national-assessment"">environment minister Lord Gardiner said</a> </p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Our changing climate is one of the most serious environmental challenges that we face as a nation and that is why we are taking action, from improving flood defences across the country to securing our critical food and water supplies. </p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Hugh Montgomery, at University College London added:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Acting on climate change can also boost people’s health.

People I know who have it are always complaining that it fails and often needs fixing. I have no cavity walls. I have thick or insulated curtains in most rooms and I don't have heating all day.

The South African government has been vocal in its commitment to the fight against climate change for many years, and there is a genuine popular understanding of the problem and consequences of climate change. </p> <p>One reason for that is that ordinary people can already see the effects of climate change very clearly.

From 2010 to 2016 we have already reached 8.4 million people affected by drought and 875,000 by flooding. So we will see at least a third more over the decade if the trend continues.</p> <p>But I’ve seen from my own experience that it’s the variability of weather phenomena that poses the greatest challenges to farmers in Malawi, especially when combined with an already fragile situation. People are selling their last assets and so are going into the next cycle even poorer, and unpredictability makes it very hard to plan and adapt. </p> </blockquote>    <p>Wedenig says these changes affect the poor disproportionately.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I’ve travelled widely in Africa but when I got here last year I was really shocked by the amount of acutely malnourished children.

Even if your current boiler is working well, it’s worth thinking about a replacement if it is more than 15 years old. Your fuel use may fall by a third or more, repaying the cost in lower fuel bills.<br></li> <li>The distance you drive matters. Reducing the mileage of the average new car from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year will save more than a tonne of CO2, about 15% of the average person’s footprint. If car travel is vital, think about leasing an electric vehicle when your existing car comes to the end of its life. A battery car will save you money on fuel, particularly if you drive tens of thousands of miles a year. Even though the electricity to charge your car will be partly generated in a gas or coal power station, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/electric-car-sales-set-to-pass-2m-landmark-globally-by-end-of-2016"">electric vehicles</a> are so much more efficient that total CO2 emissions will fall.<br></li> </ul>    <ul> <li>But bear in mind that the manufacture of an electric car may produce more emissions than the vehicle produces in its lifetime. Rather than buying a new electric vehicle, it may be better to keep your old car on the road by maintaining it properly and using it sparingly. The same is true for many other desirable items; the energy needed to make a new computer or phone is many times the amount used to power it over its lifetime. Apple says 80% of the carbon footprint of a new laptop comes from manufacturing and distribution, not use in the home.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T08:35:02.016Z"">at 8.35am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-588075ede4b00b8fc2ae2331"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/mark-rice-oxley""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T08:29:21.869Z"">8.29am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe/"" data-alt=""Interactive""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/drought-zip/giv-3902UC6IBD3dasNe/"">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Further west, the contraction of Lake Chad over the past four decades has created a very different set of problems for surrounding countries, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad.

Here are three of his suggestions for individual action that will cumulatively make a real impact on humankind’s carbon emissions:</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Air travel is usually the largest component of the carbon footprint of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/18/climate-change-airport-expansion-heathrow"">frequent flyers</a>. A single return flight from London to New York – including the complicated effects on the high atmosphere – contributes to almost a quarter of the average person’s annual emissions. The easiest way to make a big difference is to go by train or not take as many flights.</p>    <p><strong>2</strong> The second most important lifestyle change is to eat less meat, with particular emphasis on meals containing beef and lamb. Cow and sheep emit large quantities of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/12/rapid-rise-methane-emissions-10-years-surprises-scientists"">methane</a>, a powerful global warming gas. A vegan diet might make as much as a 20% difference to your overall carbon impact but simply cutting out beef will deliver a significant benefit on its own.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Home heating is next. Poorly insulated housing requires large quantities of energy to heat. If you have properly insulated the loft and filled the cavity wall, the most important action you can take is to draft-proof the house, something you can do yourself. Those with solid brick or stone walls will also benefit from adding <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/10/the-innovators-chicken-feathers-students-greener-home-insulation"">insulation</a>, but the financial benefits are unlikely to cover the cost of doing the work, over time.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T07:55:45.153Z"">at 7.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5880681be4b0f0efb00f596d"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""profile/mark-rice-oxley""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T07:30:11.929Z"">7.30am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>First things first – the facts. I know this is the post-fact era, and it’s become rather unfashionable to grub around looking for the truth. But here goes anyway:</p> <p>1) Warming is happening fast. No doubt about it. For most of the 20th century, average global temperatures bimbled around the 13.5C mark. Now they are closer to 15C. </p> <p>The UK’s Met Office has produced a nice visual of this which really brings home how static temperatures were for a long period, before the past 20 years or so:</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gfCoNPzGDY""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1gfCoNPzGDY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Getting warm</figcaption> </figure>   <p>2) Scientists agree we are doing this to ourselves. Often good journalism involves balancing arguments. If you quote a Democrat, you need a Republican for balance. If you quote someone in favour of chocolate biscuits, you want a counter view. <br></p> <p>This has leached into climate journalism, but the vast majority of scientists support the hypothesis that manmade action is contributing to climate change.<br></p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-12T11:41:05/embed.html"" data-alt=""Graphic""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-12T11:41:05/embed.html"">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>As this chart makes clear, if we want to strike a fair balance of voices in reporting climate change, we need to speak to more than 30 people who believe in manmade climate change before we give a platform to a sceptic. So we will do that today. We will hear from 30 or so people in the former camp. And we will remind you of what the world’s most famous climate sceptic, Donald Trump, has said.<br></p> <p>3) BUT … THERE IS HOPE. There are many great things going on. We’re going to hear lots about these too: what is happening right now, and what you can do to join the global movement. </p> <p>Carbon emissions are flatlining (but need to start falling).

That’s understandable: he has called global warming a hoax and appointed climate-change deniers and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/11/rex-tillerson-big-oil-trump-cabinet"">oil barons </a>to key posts.</p> <p>But the unpredictable Trump and his team have already <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-pick-for-secretary-of-state-backs-paris-climate-accord/"">stepped back from a threat to abandon the global climate deal</a> agreed in Paris in 2015. Hope remains – just – that with the right advice and pressure, Trump may see the challenge of climate change as the great opportunity it also represents.</p> <p>Beating climate change requires nothing less than rewiring the global economy to run on zero-carbon energy – work that must start now but will take decades. As the climate economist<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/06/nicholas-stern-climate-change-review-10-years-on-interview-decisive-years-humanity""> Lord Nicholas Stern</a> tells the Guardian: “The urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood.”</p> <p>But this titanic challenge also offers extraordinary opportunities: trillion dollar markets for green technology and the prospect of a clean, sustainable and fair world.

Even <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/10/saudi-arabia-submits-climate-pledge-to-un-deal"">Saudi Arabia</a>, which for years frustrated global climate talks, is now <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-16/saudis-seek-up-to-50-billion-for-first-phase-of-renewables-plan"">backing the renewables revolution</a> with billions.<br></p> <p>The prize of beating climate change is a glittering one and still just within reach. Global carbon emissions have levelled off. But that only means we are no longer accelerating towards the climate cliff edge – just speeding along at a steady 100mph towards the “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report"">severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts</a>” projected by the world’s scientists.</p> <p>A foretaste of those severe weather impacts has already arrived in many places, via scorching heatwaves and floods made far more likely by the overheating planet. To avoid climate breakdown, emissions must fall to zero in a few decades at most and that means ramping up action right now. Given the scale of the challenge, people can feel powerless to make a difference. But ask the key players around the world what individuals can do and one answer recurs more than cutting down on flying, giving up meat and saving energy: demand action from your elected representatives today.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-19T07:18:42.447Z"">at 7.18am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-587fa3d8e4b0f0efb00f5570"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/mark-rice-oxley""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-19T07:03:18.920Z"">7.03am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">What we're doing today</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ"" data-alt=""icon""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/01/advice-zip/giv-3902uhd5CM1TiVOQ"">icon</a> </figure>  <p>Hello and welcome to this live climate change special, in which we will be reporting from all seven continents on the climate change already underway – and the promise of solutions – in one 24-hour period. <br></p> <p>The plan is this: starting in London, we will generally follow the sun as daybreak falls around the world.

What we’ve seen, as we’ve travelled around the world, is that regardless of what climate deniers (yes, deniers) like Trump may say about the science, the stark reality is that it is happening now. Both scientists and people at the front lines of climate change – in low-lying Pacific islands where freshwater supplies are being contaminated by salt; in poor farming Cambodian communities, where “life is a high-wire act with no safety net” – agree: there is no ambiguity. We are no longer fighting to stop climate change, but fighting to stop a runaway catastrophe. Governments must step up and take action. But in the meantime, we must all do what we can. We’ve heard people fighting climate change all around the world give their advice for what individuals can do, and most of them said similar things: become active on the issue, make your views known to politicians, and become a climate voter. Exactly what the Trump administration means for the world is not yet clear, but even if the Paris Agreement is weakened – even if the work is undone – not all hope is lost. There are signs that China might take a lead on climate change action, and investment in renewable energy around the globe seems unstoppable now. Thank you for joining us in our Global Warning project, and particularly those of you who have contributed to it in the comments or on social media. We’ve been struck by the thoughtfulness and nuance of your discussion; on the whole, it’s hard not to feel a little more optimistic. “For those standing on the precipice of life the impacts of climate change are an ever present reality,” writes Anika Molesworth, a young Australian working at at an agricultural research centre in Cambodia. She writes that the poorest farmers in Southeast Asia are those most vulnerable to climate extremes and seasonal vagaries. “For these farmers, many who live at subsistence level and survive on less that $1US a day, life is a high-wire act with no safety net. One stroke of bad luck – a drought, flood or pest outbreak – and they tumble further into hardship. … “Not a day goes by that I don’t stand in awe at an under-resourced team committed to moving mountains despite the odds lined up against them.” Much of the way we discuss climate-change mitigation focuses on supply: how to produce more energy, more cleanly. But some of the most fascinating conversations about climate-change in India are about reducing demand. India is a society undergoing enormous changes. Between now and 2040, the population of its cities will swell by an estimated 315m people – roughly the current population of the US. Over the next years, the estimated 240m Indians who currently lack access to electricity will be connected to the grid. The half-billion Indians who still rely on fuel wood for cooking will transition to using stoves. And by some rough projections, around 70% of the buildings that will exist in India in 2030 are yet to be built. Experts such as Navroz Dubash aren’t just thinking about how to power these changes, but how to lock in systems – of moving, cooking, cooling and lighting – that use a fraction of the energy it takes to power the same tasks in the west. One example he gives is appliances. The Indian government has started paying rebates to manufacturers who can produce more energy efficient 40-watt fans to reduce the drain during the nation’s sweltering summers. A bigger example – hundreds of thousands of high rises will spring up across Indian cities in the next 15 years. Energy researcher Radhika Khosla points out: building them to capture natural sunlight will reduce dependence on electric light. These opportunities exist across every sector. Investing in rail freight networks would use less energy, long-term, than trucking freight by road. Convincing Indians to cook using gas, instead of electricity, would also substantially cut energy use. Transport emissions too could be slashed if the hundreds of millions of Indians who flood into cities in the next decades could work within a short distance of their homes. “There’s a way to lock in institutional changes, technological changes and behavioural changes that are very difficult to undo,” Khosla says. “And that opportunity exists for countries like India, that are on the verge of great transitions.” Now we move to Mongolia, which is experiencing a disaster called a dzud, an extreme weather phenomenon commonly comprising heavy snow falls and temperatures below -40C. The dzud starves livestock as they are unable to graze, which in turn can devastate Mongolians, a third of whom are entirely dependent on livestock. The country used to suffer dzuds every decade or so but recently they have been occurring with growing frequency. This one is the second in a row. The full extent of the dzud will not be known until the end of spring but last year’s killed more than 1.1 million livestock and left hundreds of thousands of Mongolian herders living on the brink. Months of consistently heavy snow coverage and arctic temperatures have sparked fears of another devastating humanitarian crisis. The government has called for donations of warm clothing, food, medication for livestock, coal, hay, animal feed, insulation materials and other useful items for herders to help them survive the winter while preventing livestock deaths. Some areas of the country have already recorded temperatures as low as -50C and local media reports that more than 70% of Mongolia is covered with thick snow and ice. A dzud typically arrives after a summer drought or an early winter snow that melts then freezes over the land, cutting off food for livestock. Experts say the rising frequency is due to a combination of climate change and insufficient grasslands for large herds of livestock. Telmen Erdenebileg, Save the Children’s humanitarian program manager in Mongolia, is leading the organisation’s dzud response and has just returned from one of the worst affected provinces, Arkhangai. “The coming months are critical for herder families in the most heavily impacted areas. The end of winter is when stores of hay and fodder run out, and if there’s another large snowfall or temperatures remain so low we could see massive numbers of animals dying of starvation once again,” he told the Guardian from Ulaanbaator. “Just last week herders told me how they lost half or even three quarters of their herd last winter, and they are worried about what awaits them in the next few months. Livestock are everything out there: a source of food, nutritious milk, warm clothing with their skins and a commodity for trade or sale. Without animals, herders have no livelihood. Last year, Save the Children’s response to the dzud included distributing animal fodder and veterinary packages, fuel to help hospitals and schools, and cash grants for the most vulnerable families to buy essentials like warm clothing and nutritious food. Suppakorn Chinvanno, at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, has been creating maps that show dramatically how temperature changes will affect the Southeast Asia region, if high CO2 emission continues. Below is a map of Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, as well as parts of Myanmar and Malaysia. It shows the average daily maximum temperature from 1980 and projected to 2090. Chinvanno says the map suggests the region – already vulnerable to droughts and floods – is going to suffer more extreme and more frequent “abnormal weather patterns”. That’s to say, much longer dry periods with intense heat that could devastate agriculture, of which about a third of the population currently relies on. That said, rainfall could actually increase, he says, but it will come in shorter bursts with more intense downpours. His climate change model also suggests a possible half-metre rise in the sea level in some areas of Thailand, which will magnify flood risk along the coast. Over the past year, Thailand has been experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades and rice farmers are struggling. As we heard earlier, this was followed by terrible floods, one that killed 25 people this month and cut off large areas of the country. The below map shows the average daily minimum temperature during the same period, displaying how it will not only get much hotter but parts of the country will hardly cool down, a necessity for some crops to thrive. These scenarios are based on projections in which emission remain high. But even simulations that show lower CO2 levels have a similar result. Now Chinvanno is researching adaptations, in which Thailand moves to deal with the effects of climate change by changing farming strategies, boosting flood defences and water storage practices. “What we can do is to make ourselves more resilient,” he said. We’re reaching the end of our 24 hour blog, so it’s time to check the carbon countdown clock again. This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. By the time this blog finishes, the world will have emitted an estimated 112m tons (CO2-e) of greenhouse gases. Bangladesh is already one of the most climate vulnerable nations in the world, and global warming will bring more floods, stronger cyclones. Karen McVeigh, the Guardian’s global development reporter, filed this report from the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar where the fish-drying process is well underway. It can continue through to February or March if the weather is good. But Aman Ullah Shawdagor, a dry fish (known as shutki in Bangla) businessman who employs 70 people, said that rising tides and recent changes in the seasons has hit his business. “This is a dry season business. But for the last couple of years, the rain has become more frequent.” Scientists predict that, by 2050, as many as 25 million people in Bangladesh will be affected by sea level rise. We’re into the last hour of this marathon effort, and we’d love to hear from you before it’s all over – join us in the comments, and let us know what you think of either the 24-hour blog or the somewhat grim tidings it’s brought. From 4pm to 5pm Sydney time, here’s what we explored: Solar power can drive a tuk-tuk from India to the UK: imagine the possibilities! Tim Flannery pens a sobering opinion piece about the threats posed by climate change to Australia’s unique wildlife The world’s climate-vulnerable megacity: is Mumbai ready for the big one? Australia’s conservative government fiddles as the country burns, writes Guardian Australia’s editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor If you’ve ever doubted the effects of climate change on coral reef, check out our before-and-after interactives “This is not a drill,” says the Climate Council in a pop culture reference-riddled video for Facebook ... and First Dog on the Moon presents his call to arms he means flippers! Definitely flippers! Stop the press. First Dog On the Moon has filed a #GlobalWarning cartoon. Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin says: “This is a call to arms I mean flippers! A call to flippers!” If the grim statistics and worldwide perspective we’ve been reporting over the past 23 hours haven’t made an impact, perhaps this video with pop culture references put to jaunty music will. Here’s a video Australia’s Climate Council just released on Facebook: We’ve had a few posts about the effects of climate change on coral reefs. In particular, earlier in the day we had an interview with coral biologist Anne Hoggett, who lives and works on Lizard Island, in the remote northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. She spoke about the process coral goes through when it first bleaches, and then eventually dies. Here are a set of interactive before-and-after images we have, taken from Lizard Island, that show that very process. And if you want to read an in-depth feature about the 2016 global coral bleaching event, here’s one we published a few months ago: Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. When Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister of Australia, it was hoped there’d be serious action on global warming – but the conservative government continues to fiddle on climate policy while the country burns, writes Guardian Australia’s editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor. Since you’re here … … We have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever but far fewer are paying for it. And advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too. If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. Tamil Nadu’s water crisis is a glimpse at the way climate change is already exacerbating environmental and political tensions in India. For future threats, go 1,300km northwest to Mumbai, India’s flashy financial capital – and the world’s climate-vulnerable megacity. To start with, much of the city was actually built on water: by rubble poured into the seas and swamps that separated seven islets in the Arabian sea. That process of reclamation continues today, and has severely distorted the terrain’s ability to deal even with unexceptional rainfall. A 2013 study found flooding would cost Mumbai around US$6.4b each year by 2050. It also means huge swathes of the city are low-lying. If sea levels rise at predicted rates, according to early research, around 40% of Mumbai could be submerged by the end of the century. A day of freak rainfall in July 2005 saw chest-high flooding in parts of the city and killed 500 people. But the real nightmare scenario is a category 4 or 5 storm blowing in from the Arabian sea. A new book by Amitav Ghosh, one of India’s best-known writers, imagines this very scenario. In the event of a two-to-three metre storm surge, Ghosh writes: “Waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm surge would meet and merge. In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once again become islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water.” Luckily, no storm like that has been seen in Mumbai in recent memory. But meteorologists are nearly unanimous in the view that increasing global temperatures will make tropical storms more severe. And a 2012 paper cited by Ghosh in his book predicts a 46% increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Arabian sea over the course of the century. Is Mumbai ready – either for “the big one”, or even just increased floods? I asked Atul Deulgoankar, an author and member of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority. He said: “I’ve been part of the disaster management authority since its inception in 2006. In that time, not a single government, not a single chief minister or chief secretary has taken an interest in disaster-risk reduction. In 2005, we experienced heavy flooding because just one river was choked. And nothing has been done about that. There has been no campaign to clear water bodies or rivers. Nothing is happening systematically.” Tim Flannery, Australian palaeontologist, environmentalist and member of the Climate Council has penned a sobering opinion piece in the Guardian today, outlining the threat climate change is posing to Australia’s unique wildlife. And as he says, meanwhile, Australia is doing very little to improve their outlook: ...while other countries are winding down their coal use, Australia is attempting to ramp up our production and export of the product, all the while as we watch first-hand the immediate and long term damage coal and fossil fuels are wreaking on our planet, on people and on nature. You can read the full piece here: Naveen Rabelli, a 35-year-old engineer, wanted to show the power and potential of clean energy, so he designed and built a solar powered tuk-tuk and drove it 9,000 miles from India to the UK. “The moment I tell them it doesn’t require petrol, their minds are blown,” he said in September last year after he arrived in Dover following a seven month-long journey. His journey shows there is a sustainable alternative for the millions of tuk-tuks around the world. Read more about Rabelli’s journey here. Two more hours until we’ve gone round the world in 24 hours of climate change – thanks for following along, and particularly for the lively discussion below the line. We’d love to highlight and respond to more of your comments in the final stretch, so keep them coming. If you’re just joining us, in the past hour: We’ve heard how climate change is affecting already extreme climate in Australia’s Northern Territory Deforestation, and the role it plays in carbon emissions, has been explained in a neat infographic by The Wilderness Society Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann shared his strategy on defeating climate deniers We’ve checked back in with the effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef – is the Australian government really doing all it can do to save its natural wonder? A short clip on the British Antarctic Survey’s activity at Rothera research station explains the answers to be found in Antarctica Oliver Holmes has reported back from southern Thailand, where unseasonably heavy rains have marked the start of what should be the dry season And is slowing the birth rate really the solution to climate change? It may be not so simple. A reader, witness67, has suggested that a “generational solution” to climate change is to “stop breeding”. But, as another commenter pointed out, that’s not necessarily the be-all and end-all. Global population is forecast to climb steadily, reaching 8.5bn in 2030, 9.7bn in 2050 and 11.2bn in 2100 – but the overall rate has been falling since the 1970s, and demographics are shifting. The number of births have peaked, or levelled off globally; the growth in population is due mostly to people living longer. We looked beyond the top line projections in a data blog last year. Here in Thailand, the south of the country has been experiencing unseasonably heavy rains, unusual for what should be the start of the dry season. More than 25 people have died and close to a million people, or 360,000 households, have been affected, with homes submerged in water. At one hospital, 100 patients had to be evacuated on small boats after the building was hit by overflowing reservoirs. A flash flood washed out a bridge on the country’s main north-south highway, backing up traffic for 200 km (125 miles). Footage on local television channels showed abandoned cars submerged in muddy water. The railway link was also cut off and the Department Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said that the main airport in the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat would remain shut for the foreseeable future. Thailand’s rainy season usually ends in November. This year, intense rain has fallen well into what should be the dry season. There is debate among scientists on the reasons for the extreme weather we’re seeing in Thailand, with many pointing to the cyclical El Niño and La Niña patterns, in which oscillations in the temperatures between the atmosphere and the ocean create storms. It’s hard to isolate the impact of global warming, but increasing temperatures will lead to longer, more intense droughts and increasingly devastating flooding. Widespread floods in 2011 killed more than 900 people and caused major disruption to business, cutting economic growth that year in Thailand to just 0.1 %. We’ve heard quite a bit about Antarctica in the blog so far – both as a career-making site for scientists and a point of ongoing exploration. There’s good reason for that. What happens in Antarctica affects us all, as this video of British Antarctic Survey’s activity at the Rothera Research Station on the western Antarctic peninsula goes to show. In the future, this landscape could be almost barren; right now, it’s a living laboratory in which to study organisms being affected by climate change. For a live look at Rothera station, check out BAS’ webcam. A few commenters have argued that Australia isn’t doing enough to protect the Great Barrier Reef. It’s also worth remembering that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and yet the government’s current policies leave it with no hope of meeting its emissions reduction targets. Here’s an interactive we recently made, showing the government’s own projected emissions, plotted against the reduction commitments we made as part of the Paris Agreement. Click “zoom out” to see how much we are set to miss our targets by. Renowned climate scientist Michael E Mann from the University of Pennsylvania will soon be visiting Australia as a guest of the Sydney Environment Institute and speaking at the University of Sydney in February. Ever since he and his colleagues did pioneering work, gathering temperatures from various records over the past 1000 years, and plotted them on a graph that became known as the “hockey stick graph”, Mann has been at the centre of a vicious fight between climate scientists and climate deniers. Ahead of his visit, I asked him over email about the role of climate deniers in Australian politics and what concerned citizens can do help stop climate change. Question: You’ve spent a long time battling with climate deniers. In Australia, we have a number of climate deniers both in the government and in the rest of the parliament. We also have a federal government that has no effective policies to curb carbon emissions. Do you think climate deniers are driving climate policy here in Australia. And if so, what is the best strategy to fight them? Michael Mann: Sadly, climate change deniers do indeed continue to have a voice in our public and policy discourse that is out of proportion with the merit of their views, thanks in large part to a megaphone that they have been granted by conservative media. The Murdoch media empire in particular – whose role is featured in our recent book ‘The Madhouse Effect: How Climate Change Denial is Threatening Our Planet, Destroying Our Politics, and Driving Us Crazy” — has played a particularly vital role in the climate change disinformation campaign, and they dominate the news industry in Australia. Keep in mind that the second largest shareholder in NewsCorps, after Rupert Murdoch, is the Saudi Royal family, who obviously have a stake in our continued addiction to fossil fuels. As a consequence, they dominate the public discourse and provide cover for climate change-denying politicians. It is hardly surprising this has led to climate policy in Australia being driven by fossil fuel interests and their advocates. As for strategies to fight them, one of them is to speak out and to hold them accountable—which is something I do actively, whether it is speaking to the media, giving public lectures, writing commentaries and op-eds, and books. My ‘Madhouse Effect” lecture is really about how to move beyond climate change denial and get on to the legitimate debate about what to do about the threat of human-caused climate change. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Michael Mann: We must hold our elected representatives responsible for representing our interests rather than the profits of polluting interests. Among other things, we must make sure to vote, and to be climate voters. A few people have mentioned the big role land-clearing plays in climate change. In Australia, it’s a big issue, with improvements made in previous years looking like they’re going to be undone, with new laws in Queensland and NSW making land clearing easier. The folks at The Wilderness Society have just put together this graphic, explaining the issue nicely. In Australia’s Northern Territory climate conditions are already extreme, with high heat, floods, monsoons, cyclones, and fires, and its economy relies heavily on industries affected by climate, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism. But it doesn’t have much of a plan to deal with the effects of climate change, says David Morris, head of the Environmental Defenders Office. He tells the Guardian there have been some “positive noises” from the newly elected Labor government around renewable energy and increased funding and incentives, but notes that it’s one of the few jurisdictions without an adequate and current coastal management plan. “I doubt you could find many capital cities around the world that don’t have a coastal management strategy, that don’t have a climate change adaptation plan, and the Northern Territory is a place which is going to feel the effects of climate severely. “New roads, new pipelines, housing development, any kind of infrastructure you want to put in, any kind of decision you want to make under legislation where you’re spending public money, should now take into account climate change. “When you look at NT government information about climate change, it’s scant, there’s basically nothing. I mean, we’ve got sea level rise and that’s it.” Morris says current estimates are a sea level rise of 1.1m by 2100 would see between 250 and 400 residential buildings inundated by seawater, and would put 200km of NT roads, valued at just under AU $2 billion, at risk. Ecologically and economically significant tourism areas like Kakadu national park are also under threat, with increasing risks of saltwater intrusion threatening the fragile wetlands. We’re in the final stretch now. Here’s what we’ve covered in the last hour: The first-ever all-female expedition to Antarctica asks the question: is climate change a gender equality issue? Blair Palese, the chief executive of 350.org Australia, on how climate change deniers take their tactics “straight out of the tobacco playbook”; 350.org’s campaign against the Carmicheal coal mine; and what you can do to help combat climate change China correspondent Tom Phillips takes his air pollution-monitoring “egg” for a walk around Beijing – and runs into Boris Johnson The sperm bank that could hold the secret to saving the world’s coral reefs We’d love to hear more from you below the line, or on Twitter: I’m at @mlle_elle, Mikey is @MikeySlezak, and we’re using the hashtag #GlobalWarning. It’s also been some hours since you were last made aware of a penguin. And here’s the final part of our Q&amp;A with Blair Palese, chief executive of 350.org Australia. Question: What’s the most important thing that individuals can do to help prevent climate change? Blair Palese: I think it’s important that we all take responsibility for climate change as we’ve all been part of the system that created it. We have the power to decide who governs us and what issues made the priority agenda no matter what vested interests do or say to stymie action. And as consumers we have huge power to decide where our money goes. Anyone concerned about climate change needs to engage in politics, call your elected officials, email them, meet them at events and tell them you want urgent action or you’ll vote them out. Talk to people about it in your community, take steps together locally to make a difference. And think hard about what you are doing with your money. If you don’t like what your bank or superfund is investing in – say fossil fuel projects – tell them that and move to one that is fossil free. Finally, get involved with a group or issue you care about – help us stop the Adani coal mine, take on Chevron’s plans to drill in the Bight, switch your power company from the big three to a company investing in and campaigning for renewable energy. If you don’t have time, donate to keep the campaigning alive. Any one of these steps will make a real difference. Here’s another part of the Q&amp;A I did with 350.org Australia’s chief executive Blaire Palese. Here she discusses the recent suceses of the climate movement, and what we’re going to see this year. Question: Despite some big setbacks, the climate movement has claimed some victories too. It now looks like the whole movement in Australia is focussing on stopping Adani building the Carmichael Coal mine. What will that campaign look like? Blaire Palese The divestment of more than A$6 trillion (US$5.2 trillion) from fossil fuels is something I and the 350.org team are particularly proud of. The campaign started off very much as a symbolic effort. But much to our amazement after three years, it was all about money – and lots of it! – being moved from coal, oil and gas. Some 688 institutions and 58,399 individuals across 76 countries have committed to divest in some way. This is a real indicator that people are frustrated with government inaction and are taking their own steps to be part of the climate change solution. The Victorian gas ban could not have been achieved without a strong coalition of farmers, rural communities and city progressives that became a force that could not be ignored by the Andrews Government. Getting BP to drop plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight was a different story, with environmental groups using delaying tactics and the threat of a global public campaign to ensure the project was too costly and unviable. Right now, efforts to stop Adani from building the world’s largest new coal mine in Queensland is, for most of us concerned about climate change, the most critical fight in the country right now. Australia hasn’t opened up a new mineral reserve in 40 years, and if the Adani project goes ahead, the whole Galilee Basin could be developed, which would unleash enough coal to tip the carbon budget not just for us, but for the whole world. A broad coalition of environmental groups, local communities and Traditional Owners are coming together to do all we can to ensure this project doesn’t see the light of day. If you’d like to do something about climate change, join us to stop this climate-threatening coalmine! While the Queensland state government has said it’s doing all that it can to preserve the Great Barrier reef, a different kind of preservation work has been ongoing far from the reef – even the coastline – in regional New South Wales. Since 2011, scientists from Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Smithsonian Institution have been collecting and freezing coral sperm to store at Taronga’s CryoReserve in Dubbo. The project began in Australia in 2011, but has international partners that ensure the preservation of coral reefs worldwide. “It’s a bigger collaboration than just the Great Barrier Reef,” said coral scientist Bec Hobbs. By freezing the cells in liquid nitrogen to preserve them indefinitely, scientists can use similar technology as sperm-banking for human IVF to grow new coral and make entire reef systems more resilient to coming change. Researchers are also investigating the possibility of freezing coral eggs and larvae. There are more than 600 species of coral on the Great Barrier Reef – in the last spawning event in November, scientists were able to add four more to the bank, said Hobbs. “At the moment we have samples from about a meagre 11 species, but that is still the most species that are banked anywhere in the world.” But their efforts to collect more species have been frustrated by lack of knowledge about reefs and coral reproduction. “We know quite a bit about certain species and others, relatively nothing,” said Hobbs. The research currently being carried out by Reef Recovery Initiative partners, then, is all the more vital for preserving the future of reefs. Our correspondents around the region have been monitoring the air quality in their various cities. While Beijing is usually incredibly smoggy, Tom Phillips is reporting unusually blue skies and remarkably low PM2.5 readings. But when Tom descended into the subway, things didn’t look so great. Blair Palese is the chief executive of 350.org Australia. I asked her a series of questions about the climate movement here and abroad. Here’s the first question and answer: Question: The rise of Trump in the US, and the continued lack of federal action on climate change here in Australia, must be seen in some ways as a failure of the climate movement. What lessons can be learned from what’s happened in recent years and how can the climate movement win? Blair Palese: Climate change is an incredibly difficult issue for people to get their heads around. Complex, yes, but more importantly, made confusing by media with vested interests questioning climate change science – a tactic straight out of the tobacco playbook. Understanding that science is never 100% certain is not something most of us think much about, so it’s easily exploited. And, as our movement is up against the most cashed up industry in the world – the fossil fuel industry – it’s a David vs Goliath battle to convince people and politicians that the longer we wait, the harder and more expensive are the steps we must take to stop climate change. That said, those working on the issue do need to reach out more broadly to everyone, everywhere about the importance of the issue and ensure our movement spans the political, race, gender and age spectrum to be truly representative. It’s worth remembering that the People’s Climate Marches of 2015 saw more than 600,000 people take to the streets in 175 countries -- by all accounts the biggest thing of its kind in history. Our job now is not only to raise the alarm about climate change but to communicate the huge benefits we will all get from solving it. Our voices need to be loud and varied if we are to successfully stand up to fossil fuel dollars. Come back soon to see some more Q&amp;A’s with Blaire. The Homeward Bound Project aims to take 1000 women working in science around the world to Antarctica to increase their influence and impact in policy and decision-making. Belinda Fairbrother, the community conservation manager at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, was part of the inaugural contingent of 76 women to spend 22 days in Antarctica in December: the largest-ever female expedition to Earth’s southernmost continent. She said the impacts of climate change were keenly felt there, with the Antarctic peninsula was among the fastest-warming places in the world and penguin populations suffering. “It really brings home the challenges we face elsewhere in the world.” Having met scientists at Palmer Station, a US station in the Antarctic, she realised that no progress was possible alone, and that storytelling was as important as facts in mobilising people to act. “In these remote landscapes, that’s what really struck me – we need to work together, past issues and conflict. Going forward, that radical collaboration is what we’re going to need to deal with climate change as a global issue.” Hearing personal accounts of knowledgeable people experiencing the effects of climate change firsthand and working to combat them helped to mobilise her, said Fairbrother: “Data’s only going to get us so far. … Climate change is real but what’s also real is people’s innovation and ability to stand up to issues like this.” Fairbrother also said her experience had shown her that gender equity and more equal decision-making was a key part of the solution to climate change. The Homeward Bound Project aims to elevate each participant’s leadership capabilities and profile with view to addressing underrepresentation of women in positions of power and influence, “to impact policy and decisions towards a sustainable future”. There are already hundreds of women waitlisted for the second program, to depart in 2018. We started on Lizard island and went all the way to China, by way of the Tumblrverse and a possible planet populated only by carp. “There’s no time to lose”: a coral reef scientist urges governments to act on carbon emissions Street violence over water supplies not some future dystopia, but a present reality in Tamil Nadu, southern India John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, comments on the slow-moving gains of climate policy China correspondent Tom Phillips reports back from one of the largest solar farms on Earth in Qinghai province Millennial lobby group Generation Zero gets to advocates young in New Zealand The worst mangrove dieback in recorded history in Australia’s Northern Territory, and the ramifications for that coastline Smog from China aggravates a severe air pollution problem in Hong Kong Mikey Slezak looks to the future Calla Wahlquist with the latest on “fire behaviour” analysis in Victoria, Australia’s most fire-prone state China doubles down on its pledge to cut carbon emissions – no matter what the Donald may do Meanwhile, here’s the carbon countdown again – only 27.5% of the total carbon budget remaining in tons (CO2-e), if we want to to limit human-induced warming to less than 2C. And here’s a thoughtful response to CassandrasVoice’s earlier question about how long – specifically – we’ve got before climate change has severe enough impact on the majority for us to act. Li Shuo, a Beijing-based campaigner for Greenpeace, is among the activists hoping that China, the world’s largest polluter, will take up a greater leadership role on climate change in a post-Trump world. Li is an expert in clean energy, air pollution and climate change and also studied US-China relations at Nanjing University in east China. Writing in the Guardian today, Li argues that Trump’s election “casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation” but says Beijing’s apparent willingness to take on a larger role offers some hope. You can read Li’s full piece here: I recently sat down over Skype with the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, David Ritter. I pressed him on whether or not the election of Trump in the US meant that the public has stopped caring for climate change. He was adamant that was not the case. “There’s much that might be said about this election but i don’t think we can in any way treat it as a mandate for inaction,” he said. “One of the sad ironies of protest electoral votes may be that some of those who have been most left behind by an economic system that is deepening inequality, and are lashing out and voting for candidates seen as anti-establishment, are also people that are at the greatest risk from global warming when we see extreme weather events, we see extreme temperatures and so on. So I don’t think there’s any doubt that inequality and climate change are intimately, intimately connected.” Check out the full video below. And tweet your comments or thoughts to me at @mikeyslezak or to David at @David_Ritter, or leave them below in the comments. The war on global warming is “a responsibility we must assume for future generations,” Chinese president told the world’s economic elite in Davos this week, signalling that Beijing would stay true to its pledge to cut carbon emissions, even if Donald Trump did not. China has several reasons for sticking to its guns. Firstly, there is consensus in China that the country is likely to be among the biggest victims of climate change: a 2015 government report warned rising sea levels, temperatures, and rainfall posed a real and present danger to hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens. Melting glaciers in China’s extreme west and the desertification of large swaths of land in the north have set alarm bells ringing in Beijing. Secondly, Beijing understands it must take action against deadly episodes of air pollution that are fuelling increasing public rage. China’s leaders view climate change mitigation as an effective argument with which to take on the powerful energy sector responsible for the smog, which is blamed for up to one million premature deaths per year. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, Beijing sees huge economic benefits in transitioning towards a consumption and services based low carbon economy and becoming a world-leader in the energy technologies of the future. Already its global dominance of the renewables market is becoming clear through billions of dollars of overseas investment last year in countries from Australia to Brazil and Pakistan. China is now the world’s largest investor in clean energy and recently unveiled plans to pump more than $360bn into renewable energy sources by 2020. Finally, there is the question of soft power. With a climate denier now occupying the White House, some in Beijing see a golden opportunity to boost China’s global standing by spearheading the war on global warming. Xi’s speech at the World Economic Forum - in which he urged the world to “meet the challenges of climate change” and praised the Paris climate deal as “a hard-won achievement” - suggests China may be preparing to do just that. “History,” the Chinese president told his audience to loud applause, “is created by the brave.” Lightning struck bushland east of the coastal Victorian town of Wye River on 19 December, 2015. On 25 December the fire burned the town, destroying 116 homes. Most of the residents had already been evacuated on the order of fire authorities, who mapped the fire behaviour, with astonishing accuracy, five days earlier. The mapping system, called Phoenix, allows fire behaviour analysts to input data about the terrain, dryness of the fuel, predicted temperatures, and predicted wind patterns, and come up with a predicted image of fire behaviour. Until 2010, this was done with considerably less accuracy using a pocket calculator and a slide-rule, crosshatching on paper maps. As fire behaviour analyst Andy Ackland explained in the video below, the mapping system also predicts the occurrence of convection currents, where a blast of hot air pushes through the inversion layer of the atmosphere. That’s one of the key conditions of a firestorm. The system is used to inform public warnings and help firefighters prioritise when there are multiple fires on the same day (bushfires tend to come in crops of 12, Emergency Management commissioner Craig Lapsley said). It is also used in a strategic sense to figure out which power lines are most likely to cause devastating bushfires. Ackland said it is increasingly used to map potential changes in bushfire risk caused by long-term climate change, which is drying out the mountain ash forests around Victoria and leaving them more prone to a severe bushfire. “Some of the most extreme fuel loads that you would see anywhere in the state are that type of mountain ash fuel,” Darrin McKenzie, deputy chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management said. Like many Australian trees, mountain ash has evolved to use fire to regenerate, shedding long ribbons of bark to create fuel. That strategy backfires in a catastrophic fire Black Saturday in February 2009, which burned hot enough to kill the mountain ash seeds and, with that, jeopardise the whole alpine ecosystem. An interesting comment below the line. Earlier today I posted an opinion piece I wrote today about panic and despair, and other emotions a lot of people feel when writing about climate change. In that piece I mention a moment I felt almost panicked, while I was half-way through James Bradley’s brilliant novel Clade, which is set a few decades in the future. Here’s something James has written for the blog today about the process of writing a book about the future of climate change, as that change was happening: Back in 2012, when I began writing the book that would become Clade a lot of what I was writing was science fiction. Although there was no question climate change was an urgent problem, or that its effects were already being felt, most of the direr predictions still lay somewhere over the horizon. Yet as I wrote a peculiar and discomfiting thing began to occur. Events I was weaving into the fabric of the novel – the release of methane from the seafloor and the permafrost, mass die-offs of wildlife, the breakup of the Antarctic ice sheets, even changes in the Earth’s rotation due to the shifting weight of melting ice – started to move out of the pages of the book and into reality. The sense of hastening intensifies with every passing day. A decade ago it was possible to say the window for stopping dangerous climate change was closing, but that’s no longer true. If you live in the Pacific, or Africa, or many other parts of the world dangerous climate change is already here. The question is no longer whether we can avert dangerous climate change but whether we can avert a runaway climate catastrophe. There are days when I wonder whether continuing to believe that might be possible isn’t simply denial, a refusal to confront the truth. Speak to any scientist working in a field connected to climate change and you will quickly encounter a deep seam of despair. What is happening is occurring so quickly, so irrevocably it often seems overwhelming. Yet another part of me knows this sort of despair is self-fulfilling. Change doesn’t come from giving up, it comes from practical action and engagement. But it also requires hope, and hope requires we believe change is possible. Hello from smoggy Hong Kong. Despite its reputation as a futuristic global city, Hong Kong has terrible air quality and the government has been slow to respond to the problem. Nearly all government pollution targets far exceed World Health Organization recommendations. In terms of PM2.5, tiny particles that cause haze and have been linked to cancer, government targets are three times higher than the WHO. Even during the best year for deadly PM2.5, levels were still more than twice WHO guidelines. Congested roads flanked by skyscrapers cause a “street canyon” effect, where pollution caused by road traffic can be trapped and recirculate, exacerbating the problem. Hong Kong’s port, one of the busiest in the world, is also a massive source of bad air. Ships are only required to switch to cleaner fuels when docked at port, so the entire journey sailing through the city’s waters is emitting high levels pollution. On top of that, almost all of Hong Kong’s power comes from fossil fuels. Lastly, let’s not forget Hong Kong’s neighbor to the north: China. Smog from China often wafts into Hong Kong, aggravating an already severe problem. About 20% of Australia’s coastline – 11,000km – is lined with 52 different species of mangroves, with more than a third of it in the Northern Territory. But last year something extraordinary occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, when scientists were informed of a mass dieback along a stretch about 700km long. It was the worst mangrove dieback in recorded history, covering 7,000 hectares, and came at the same time as the more highly publicised coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. Believed due to a combination of factors related to climate change, the mangrove dieback has serious ramifications for the health of that coastline and future erosion, but went largely unnoticed at the time. “Essentially the plants died because of moisture stress and that’s linked with a combination of factors,” Prof Norman Duke, an expert in mangrove ecology from James Cook University, tells the Guardian. “High temperatures obviously, a lack of rainfall, and strangely also a temporary drop in sea level at the critical time when these plants were so stressed out because of the climate itself. All these factors are related to the southern oscillation index, the El Niño southern oscillation cycles, and that means that they’re related to climate in general.” Duke says the dieback and subsequent response were pretty indicative of how the issue of climate change is dealt with in the NT. “I may not be privy to all that’s going on but from my perspective, we just have to look at the example of the die back. The only reason we know is because of concerned community members sending in pictures to me and others saying: we think something’s going wrong but nobody else is interested. That took four, five, six months in 2015 from when it was first publicised.” “It’s now well over a year since the dieback started and still there is no dedicated surveys going on on the ground to establish what has gone on, the extent of it, and what we can do about it and what are the consequences, which are potentially enormous.” When Pubudu Senanayake cycles through the Christchurch CBD he feels a quiet sense of satisfaction that New Zealanders are adapting their island home of 4.5m to be more climate-friendly. A NZ $150m cycle network in Christchurch and increased rail services in Auckland are recent wins. Senanayake is a member of youth-led lobby group Generation Zero, formed in 2011 with the aim of pushing the New Zealand government to take swifter action on climate change, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by the year 2050. He says successive governments have not “understood the urgency with which we need to act”, with emissions increasing. With over 30,000 members and high-profile, imaginative lobbying action, Generation Zero campaign as vociferously for leadership from government as they do for individual choices such as eating less meat or walking to work. A number of members, “empowered to act” while at university, have gone onto work for NGOs or in government, says Senanayake. “We try to increase youth participation in the civic process and help youth gain more skills and knowledge to have an impact at the policy level.” For Senanayake and his fellow climate warriors the pay-off is clear: a sustainable New Zealand for decades to come. “Climate change is not just an environmental issue. The symptoms are environmental but the issue is social and economic. And the urgency with which we need to take action makes me pretty devoted to it.” My colleague Tom Phillips has just filed this piece from Qinghai province in western China. Tom is back from spending two (freezing cold) days there on the Tibetan plateau visiting what is reputedly the largest solar farm on earth and one of a growing number of super-sized symbols of China’s quest to transform itself from climate villain to green superpower. “The scale of the solar park is just extraordinary and building it was clearly a huge, huge task,” says Tom. “Engineers there told me thousands of workers had taken part in construction, braving temperatures as low as -20C to turn the region into a sea of silicon panels.” You can read the full piece below and come back soon for more from Tom. John Connor has been the chief executive of the Climate Institute in Australia for 10 years. In that time, he’s seen federal climate policy begin to be established, only to be dismantled and then replaced by ongoing stagnation. I spoke with him and asked him whether the lack of movement meant the climate movement had been doing things wrong, whether Trump’s election was the death knell for the Paris Agreement, and what individuals could do to help prevent climate change. Watch the video here: Parched reservoirs, street violence over dwindling water supplies, and the emergence of a “water mafia” sound like some fevered vision of a future dystopia. Except, all three are already happening in parts of southern India, and most acutely in Tamil Nadu. One of India’s wealthiest and best developed states, Tamil Nadu is nonetheless in the grip of its worst water shortage on record. This year’s monsoon brought less than half the usual rainfall. The reservoirs that supply Chennai, the capital, are at around 13% capacity – and the state still must weather six hot months before the monsoon rains returns in July. Rural areas already appear to already be in crisis: India’s human rights agency estimates at least 106 farmers have killed themselves in the past month. It isn’t all down to climate change. “The way Tamil Nadu is geographically rendered denies it access to precipitation,” says Jayshree Vencatesan, the managing trustee at the environmental group, Care Earth Trust. Mismanagement of crops and existing water resources also takes some share of the blame. But the annual monsoon season, the state’s lifeline, is bringing less rain than it used to. And when it does finally pour, the storms are intense and brutal, causing destructive floods of the kind that have ravaged Chennai each December of the past two years, killing over 300 people. And though researchers are yet to study the link, Vencatesan says the state is “consistently warmer” than in the past. “You don’t really have a great seasonality. So, you have a monsoon, that’s followed by an intense summer – and there’s an immediate drying up of the system,” she says. Tamil Nadu has been forced to beg surrounding states for help. In September, it won a legal battle with neighbouring Karnataka state for more access to water from the Cauvery, a river the two states share. But Karnataka too is desperately thirsty. The result was days of anti-Tamil violence in the streets of the Karnataka capital, Bangalore, including the torching of dozens of Tamil-owned vehicles and businesses. Demonstrators carried signs that read: “We will give blood, but not Cauvery.” Some unscrupulous water-tanker drivers have begun to exploit the situation. Vencatasan says hundreds are involved in buying water from farmers, and hauling it to villages where supplies are low. There they hock it for a steep markup. “They haven’t reached the point of forming cartels yet,” Vencatasan says. “But they are a water mafia.” We’ve collaborated with Tumblr to create a “quilt” of user-submitted messages and artwork about climate change for this Global Warning project. Here’s my new favourite submission: “A world full of carp is probably not the long-term goal”. Let us know if you disagree in the comments! After speaking with Anne Hoggett about the devastating bleaching that hit the Great Barrier Reef, I asked her what she thinks individuals can do to help stop climate change to protect the reef from bleaching. Here’s what she said: Let our government know that you want them to take meaningful action to contain carbon emissions - now. There’s no time to lose. Throughout the afternoon, we’re going to hear from a number of people about what they think individuals can do to help stop climate change. I’ve got to say, the hours are flying by as we steer the live blog back to London. It’s 1pm here in Sydney, it’s pouring down with rain, and Mikey Slezak has just inhaled a cheeseburger in between blog posts. In the past hour: Guardian Australia’s photographer extraordinaire Mike Bowers shared a shot and a story from his trip to Kiribati, featuring prominently in our coverage today as a site on the bleeding-edge of rising sea levels Jason Roberts answered just one more question for us from Casey Station in Antarctica My colleague Calla Wahlquist reported back on how Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, approaches bushfire management David Tong, now of WWF New Zealand, gave a chilling account of household items being taken by rising sea levels in Kiribati – and locals putting sugar in their water “to counteract the salty taste” We heard from Lock the Gate, a group of Astralian farmers concerned about coal mining and gas extraction Michael Safi, the Guardian’s Asia correspondent, reported from Delhi on plans for the largest electricity rollout in history Even the Sydney Opera House faces problems posed by climate change, Guardian Australia’s Joshua Robertson found A coral reef biologist who’s been based on Lizard Island in far north Queensland for almost three decades reports back on the challenges Here’s a talking point for you to deliberate in the comments: Onwards and upwards. Yesterday I spoke with coral reef biologists Anne Hoggett. She’s lived and worked on Lizard Island in remote far North Queensland for almost three decades. She is now director of the Australian Museum’s research station there. Lizard Island was at the epicentre of the disastrous bleaching that killed about a fifth of the coral on the entire Great Barrier Reef. Check out the interview below, where Anne describes what it has been like living there, and watching the impacts of climate change hit her remote home. The business case for adapting to climate change has dawned on a growing number of organisations in Australia, including the stewards of the Sydney Opera House. The opera house is among the 10 best business cases in Australia to show how it could be done, according to a Griffith University report launched last month. The climate change risks to the World Heritage-listed building range from underground water leaks from rising sea levels and water pressure, damage from more severe storms with high winds, and flooding from more intense rainfall and run-off. The opera house has now factored in a 90cm sea level rise into its 10-yearly building renewal program. Managers told the Griffith researchers that assuming the need for climate change adaptation in its investments was a responsible “use of taxpayers’ money”. Other cases include the insurer Suncorp, which sees a growing cost of natural disasters in northern Australia in the form of cyclones, floods and hail storms as “the game changer and catalyst for change and action”. Over the last seven years in Queensland alone, insurers paid out $1.44 in claims for every $1 they collected in premiums, the study said. After Queensland’s costly 2011 floods, Suncorp assessed the cost of a levee to protect the flood-prone town of Roma at $11m – the same as it cost the government to provide emergency helicopter rescues for one flood. “This presented a very strong business case for the [Queensland] government to fund the levee, which they did,” the study said. Suncorp told the researchers that while the insurance industry has a “pretty good understanding of what the cost will look like”, this did not necessarily extend to the human costs, which are only apparent when disaster hits and insurers “turn up on the ground and start helping people rebuild their homes”. “At that point, it becomes evident that there is a range of risks and damages that are not ‘carried on anyone’s balance sheet’, for instance, mental health issues,” the study said. AlexMourinho raises an interesting point: could the way forward from our changing climate be posed by philosophy? On the subject of science intersecting with philosophy, on Wednesday I went scuba-diving off the north shore of Sydney with Peter Godfrey-Smith, an academic philosopher who’s written a book about the consciousness of cephalopods. Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness is currently available in the US and due for release in the UK and Australia in February; Godfrey-Smith’s New York Times column about octopuses and ageing is a taster. Hello from Delhi, India’s heaving capital, where, inside government ministries, plans are being devised for the largest electricity rollout in history. India will need to supply power to nearly 600m new consumers by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. How they choose to do so matters to the entire planet. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, takes climate change seriously. Extreme weather across the country, including droughts, storms, and the severest heat wave on record killed nearly 1,600 Indians, it was reported this week. Food yields are already estimated to have fallen by 6% because of higher temperatures – a phenomenon that might claim 160,000 Indian lives each year by 2050. But Modi is also emphatic that climate change “is not of [India’s] making”. Historically, the country accounts for just 3% of the world’s total carbon emissions since 1890. India is unapologetic about potentially tripling its coal use by 2030 if it means connecting every village to the grid and powering new schools, jobs and homes for hundreds of millions of its citizens. Averting a catastrophic increase in carbon emissions will come down to how much of that energy can be generated cleanly. India’s renewable energy target is hugely ambitious: an installed capacity of 175GW by 2022. To put that into perspective, the current capacity of India’s entire grid is around 310GW. So far, India doesn’t appear to be on track to hit the 175GW target – but that’s missing the point. In pursuit of such a bold aim, it has already added nearly 15GW in renewable capacity, and attracted billions of dollars in investment. The southern state of Tamil Nadu is now the site of one of the world’s largest solar power plants. India’s total renewable capacity could increase by more than 50% in the next year alone. It has already predicted it will exceed its Paris targets by nearly 60% – and do so three years early. So, while the next posts will explore the threats posed by climate change to India, it’s worth remembering: there’s some cause for optimism, too. Lock the Gate is a large group of farmers and other citizens concerned about coal mining and gas extraction. They’ve successfully fought coal seam gas extraction along the east coast of Australia, and have emerged as a force to be reckoned with. The group has just released an analysis suggesting coal mining is responsible for about half the dangerous particulate pollution in New South Wales. Georgina Woods is the New South Wales campaign coordinator at Lock the Gate and has sent this in: As well as dealing with more extreme droughts as global warming worsens, regional communities in Australia are suffering localised impacts of coal mining. Lock the Gate Alliance, a network of community groups protecting their land and water from coal and gas mining, has today released analysis showing coal mining is responsible for the majority of dangerous particulate air pollution in New South Wales. Roughly half of this is created by five of the biggest mines. They’re all in the Hunter Valley – an important agricultural region, which is home to renowned wineries and horse studs. The state’s most-polluting coal mines are choking the Hunter Valley’s skies, damaging the health of local people and their children, contributing to the hundreds of deaths in NSW that are caused every year by particulate pollution. This analysis is part of Lock the Gate’s submission to the NSW’s government’s Clean Air Plan, which closes for consultation today. A big-picture question posed by CassandrasVoice in the comments: how long have we got? It’s a tough one, but if you’ve got thoughts or ideas, we’d love to hear them. We’ve heard about the impact of rising sea levels in Kiribati, and Guardian Australia’s Mike Bowers’ personal recollection of his visit there – now David Tong, now a campaigner at WWF in New Zealand, has written about his time in South Tarawa, an atoll of only 16 sq km of land, last September. It’s quite a chilling account of living on the front line of rising sea waters. “Climate change impacts are real and obvious. On my first day in Bairiki, I walked along the beach behind the President’s house. The sea wall was broken in several places, and the beach was littered with rubbish. I couldn’t understand where all the rubbish came from – were the broken TVs from passing cruise ships or something? “My I-Kiribati colleagues explained that the rubbish on the beaches had mostly come from people’s houses. With the highest point on Tarawa only 3m above sea level, storm surges and king tides flood homes, pulling people’s property back with them. Over the following weeks and months, the sea dumps its takings back on the beaches.” David Tong said that a storm surge following Cyclone Pam flooded South Tarawa’s maternity hospital, with flooding reaching hundreds of metres inland, killing pandanus trees and destroying taro pits. “I heard talk of people putting sugar in their water, to counteract the salty taste. ... Already on Abiang, the nearest outlying island to Tarawa, salt water is bubbling up from the soil at king tides.” I-Kiribati are working to develop salt-resistant crops, and President Mamau has pledged to make a plan for every community and every island. “Our choices in the rich world will decide whether that’s possible,” said David Tong, who’s returning to Kiribati in February: “The place gets under your skin.” Victoria, the most fire-prone state in Australia, overhauled its emergency management model following the devastating Black Saturday bushfires of 9 February 2009, which killed 173 people and destroyed two small alpine towns. The result was a new control structure, Emergency Management Victoria, which operates out of the State Control Centre in Melbourne. On a day with a fire danger rating of extreme or above, or in the event of a natural disaster, the room fills up with the heads of Victoria’s fire and flood agencies. Steve Riley, manager of the centre, talked us through it. Here’s the interview: We’re going to wrap up our Q&amp;A with Jason Roberts in Antarctica now. Thanks to everyone for all the excellent questions. And thanks especially to Jason for taking the time out of his research down there to engage with us all. Apologies to those answers we didn’t get to. To close it off, here’s one last question and answer. And Jason’s answer: This is a question that we hear often, and it’s great that people are still asking it, and want to know the answer. There is some confusion around this due to the changing amount of sea ice, and confusion between it and grounded ice. The area of sea ice is changing, due mainly to changes in the ocean currents and wind, moving the sea ice around and packing it together in areas. The ice on Antarctica (the so called grounded ice) is decreasing. Like any big land mass, things vary from area to area, but overall Antarctica is losing ice. We have several independent lines of evidence to support that. The most direct way is that satellites and aircraft (including the project I’m currently in Antarctica working on) measure the height of the surface of the ice sheet using lasers and radars. They show that many of the outlet glaciers and surrounding ice catchments are lowering, which can only happen if they are losing ice. The second way is that the gravitational field of the ice can be measured from space, we can “weigh the ice sheet” and it is weighing less over time. Again like any big area, things can change from year to year, but overall the pattern is that Antarctica is losing grounded ice, and especially the smaller (and therefore quicker to respond to any changes) West Antarctic region. Kiribati: The 33 atolls and reef islands straddle the equator and are spread across an area of over 3 million square miles. The eastern Line Islands are the first place in the world to greet the sun everyday as the international date line has to bend around them so that they are on the same day as the rest of the group. For the population of 100,000 the issues facing them are complex and urgent. Extreme weather events, storm surges and tides are eroding and threatening the precious land space. More than half the population live on the main island of Tarawa. The delicate fresh water supplies that sit underneath most of the islands in what is called a water “lens” which is basically fresh water that floats on the denser salt water that surrounds the islands. The encroaching sea is making much of this supply brackish and in some cases unusable, it is also affecting the soils and in some villages the former growing areas have become a saline desert which will not support any life. Garbage and leaching from heavy metals which lie all over the islands also contaminate the precious water supplies. The infant and under 5 mortality rate sits at a shocking 56 deaths per 1000 live births (2015 UN Inter agency group) In 2014 the Kiribati Government purchased about 20 square kilometres on the island of Vanua Levu in Fiji to for Agricultural projects and fish farming. For the people of Kiribati climate change is not an argument, they live with the changes every day in complex ways that make their lives difficult and their future uncertain. They seem genuinely surprised when you tell them that there are people in Australia who don’t believe that anything is happening to the climate of the world. As I photographed Toani Benson standing in water on the ruins of a shop on Abaiang Island where he used to fill his scooter as a school child in the mid nineties remarked “perhaps you should bring those people here.” This photograph shows children bathing in one of these shallow wells in South Tarawa. Over the last 60 minutes – Readers have had their sometimes fairly technical questions about Antarctica answered by Jason Roberts via email, direct from Casey Station – thanks to Jason and the Australian Antarctic Division for their contribution Roberts commented on the seasonal closure of the British Antarctic Survey’s Halley VI research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf, announced earlier this week as a result of uncertainty over cracks in the ice We flagged a march in Sydney on Saturday, organised by Greenpeace Australia to coincide with Donald Trump’s inauguration Mikey Slezak and WWF Australia together made you even more aware of penguins on Penguin Awareness Day (let us know when you’d like us to stop) Mikey let his professionalism give way to panic (and let me just say, if Mikey’s panicking – so should the rest of us) Responding to Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from New Zealand, a reader shared a graph of 400,000 years’ data to show that the worst may be yet to come And we heard from Lisa Gershwin about how climate change may affect jellyfish To come: reporting from Australia and we’ll venture into Asia. As Matthew2012 references below the line, a British research station in Antarctica has decided to relocate its 16 staff who were due to stay there over winter due to uncertainty over growing cracks in the ice. The British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on Monday that the Halley VI research station would shut down over winter due to concerns over changes to the Brunt ice shelf. A station relocation further inland away from the chasm is already underway. Jason Roberts says: Yeah, I saw in the news about Halley VI research station having to close down over winter. The biggest factors working in Antarctica are safety and looking after the environment. You are a long way/time away from any outside help, so you need to do things properly and in a safe manner. I have never visited Halley, but imagine that it has been designed so that it can be closed down over winter and then brought back into operational order next summer, when conditions will be more favourable. The three Australian Antarctic research stations are built on rock, so luckily we don’t have to deal with this issue. I wish our British colleagues every luck with the relocation of Halley. Thanks to BettyLousGettinOut for bringing this story from 2014 to my attention. I feel quite grateful to be reporting in relative comfort from the office in Sydney (today: overcast, grey). I’ve been in touch with Australian Jellyfish expert, Lisa-Ann Gershwin – Director of the Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services. She’s written this Facebbok post for us, discussing the threat of Jellyfish taking over as the climate warms. While there’s been a lot of talk of jellyfish doing well and filling the oceans, she says not all jellyfish will be winners. Another answer from Antarctica. Jason Roberts said: That’s a very good question, and slightly outside my field of study, which is strictly Antarctica, but I’ll have a go at answering it. I think there is some evidence of older ice in Greenland than 123,000 years, but none that has been successfully recovered in an ice core, and more importantly dated. In general Greenland is much closer to the equator than Antarctica, and is more sensitive to warming air temperatures, so we think that during extended warm periods it would be a much smaller ice sheet and not extend to the coast like it currently does. When you drill an ice core, because of the way the ice had flowed over tens of thousands of years, the layers of ice that fell in any year get thinner and thinner, making it much more difficult to date the bottom of an ice core. In addition, the ice slowly moves so it can get folded up (think of the patterns your can see in rocks in road cuttings), and this disturbance in the ice at the bottom can make it very hard to use the very bottom of an ice core. Another factor for Greenland is that it is much smaller than Antarctica, so it just takes less time for the flowing ice to move to the edge and be lost to the ocean. So the ice gets replaced over much shorter timescales than in Antarctica. The geothermal energy question is good. In fact there is liquid water found at the base of Greenland in places, including the NEEM core which reached the folded ice from the last interglacial period. So yes, this is also a factor – mostly it is just a question of how long it takes for new snow to completely move to the bottom of the ice and get discharged at the edges. Trust that answered your question, Matthew2012. I must admit, I’m impressed by the level of technical knowledge being displayed below the line... Below the line, Erik Frederiksen has responded to a quote from Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst from the Otago Regional Council, in Eleanor Ainge Roy’s report from Dunedin, New Zealand. (The graph of 400,000 years of data Erik meant to link to is here.) Eleanor noted that 2016 was the hottest year on record for New Zealand, with droughts in the North Island and 11m of rain on the west coast of the South Island. Eleanor is based in Dunedin and says the southern university town is being seen as a litmus test for how the rest of the country may fare in the coming years, with numerous flat, low-lying beach side communities built on marshy land mere metres above the sea. “It all comes down to the fact that New Zealanders love to live by the ocean,” Dr Hornblow told Eleanor. “But if we were planning those homes with the wisdom we have today, we would not have people living there at all, or be building on those flat areas so close to the sea.” I don’t normally write about personal things, but recently I’ve been thinking about people’s emotional responses to the devastation that climate change has been causing – and will cause in the future. For years I’ve understood the crisis we’re facing, but I’ve managed to maintain a kind of professional distance from it – not feeling enormously strong emotions about it. But recently that’s change. Here are my thoughts about why. A question from Twitter this time, about a reported increase of ice and snow in Antarctica. Jason Roberts responds: Like anything involving such a big area as Antarctica, things vary a lot across the continent. From an Australian context, just think about floods and bushfires happening at the same time. In general Antarctica as a whole is losing some ice, with this mainly happening in West Antarctica (the bit on the South American side of the Trans Antarctic Mountains). On the larger East Antarctic side, things are a bit more in balance, with some areas losing ice, and some currently gaining ice through extra snowfall. Of course getting detailed measurements is difficult in Antarctica (there are only a few weather stations) so we rely a lot on satellites to make these measurements, so there is some uncertainty about just how large some of the changes are. To make things harder, things are changing with time as well – again, just think in an Australian context, some years are wetter than others. In Sydney Australia, there is going to be a march on the first full day after Trump is inaugurated. Greenpeace and other NGOs will be there marching to demonstrate on both climate change, and women’s rights. Another missive from the Casey Station on Antarctica. Jason Roberts: That’s an interesting question about the sea ice, and one that keeps coming up. While the air temperature and temperature at the surface of the ocean is important in forming sea ice, probably the biggest factor controlling how much sea ice is around Antarctica is the ocean currents (and the wind patterns over the water). These move the sea ice around, and can cause it to build up in certain areas as it all gets pushed together. Once this happens, it can influence the ocean, for example waves get damped out by the sea ice, which stop them breaking up the sea ice. So it is more to do with the changes in ocean and wind patterns than temperature. There isn’t much direct coupling between the changes in the sea ice and ice on the continent. Most Antarctic sea is only one year old (although there are areas of so-called “multi-year sea ice”), while the ice on the continent is much older, tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The things that affect the ice on the continent are the amount of snow that falls to replenish it, the air temperature over summer for melting it, and how stable the ice shelves are that help hold back the glaciers. Keep your questions coming below the line. WWF Australia has jumped on the penguin awareness day bandwagon too, and included a some punny jokes in their Facebook post. Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division has replied to CgGc13’s question below the line on the impact of the breaking up of the Lambert ice sheet. Jason says: The ice shelf that has a major rift in it is the Larsen ice shelf. Parts of this ice shelf collapsed around 10 years ago, that time is just disintegrated, while this time in looks like calving a big iceberg. The previous collapse reduced the forces holding back the glaciers that feed this ice shelf, and the speed up (more than doubling their speed) in the following years, although I think the most recent studies are showing that they are starting to slow back down. We can probably expect similar behaviour when this shelf calves this time. On a global scale, the glaciers feeding the Larsen are fairly small and don’t contain a huge amount of ice. But their significance is more that they are the canary in the coal mine, showing us how vulnerable these ice shelves are to changes in the surrounding ocean. Another hour has passed – here’s what we’ve covered: 20 January being Penguin Awareness Day, we’ve duly raised your awareness of penguins (let us know below the line if you’d like to be made more... aware) We heard how residents of the Solomon islands are working to strengthen forests, mangroves, reefs and other natural ecosystems that provide natural barriers to climate change How a seawall constructed in 1880 in Dunedin, in New Zealand’s South Island, has proved an inadequate barrier given contemporary challenges The Australian Antarctic Division’s Jason Roberts on his daily flights out over Antarctica – and what he sees And a selection of your thoughtful, interesting comments – please keep them coming! As Mikey mentioned, we’re about to hear from Jason for a real-time interview conducted – hopefully not-at-all haphazardly – between the Casey Station on Antarctica and the Guardian offices in Sydney. We’ve passed a selection of questions you’ve already left for him in the comments, but do send on some more. As mentioned below, we have Jason Roberts on standby at Casey Station in Antarctica ready to answer your questions about his work (see previous post), about Antarctica, or anything else! Fire your questions at us in the comments below or tweet them to me at @mikeyslezak. We’ll get them to Roberts and post the answers shortly. Jason Roberts is currently living and working at the Australian Antarctic Division’s Casey Station on Antarctica. Speaking exclusively with the Guardian this week, Roberts explained why he takes a plane out over Antarctica each day, measuring what’s underneath the ice. The work is trying to understand what controls changes in the ice, as the climate warms. “The last time we were in what’s called an interglacial - when we didn’t have the big ice sheets in the northern hemisphere – that was about 120,000 years ago when the climate was about what it’s like now,” Roberts says. “And all the evidence from around the world suggests that sea level was several meters higher than where it currently is.” But where exactly all that sea level rise came from is a mystery Roberts is trying to solve. Check out the interview we prepared earlier. NOTE: We have Roberts on standby, ready to answer your questions. Leave them in the comments below, or tweet them to @mikeyslezak and we’ll come back here with his responses. This comment, from NoMoreMrNice, praises the live blog form as a means of capturing the complexity of climate change. (In the interests of balance, I’ll try single out some critical comments soon, don’t worry!) As NoMoreMrNice notes, one of the challenges of reporting on climate change is making it seem like an immediate issue that’s unfolding now, rather than something intangible, far away in the future. These real-time, around-the-world updates are giving – if you’ll excuse the buzzword – a holistic view of the problem. A few commenters have suggested that we should run the blog for another 24 hours, or at least do so more regularly – though it’s dependant on resourcing of our offices in London, New York and Sydney, the warm response below the line is certainly an incentive to do so! St Clair beach in Dunedin is threatened by sea level rise. The first seawall was constructed in 1880 to protect the homes and businesses of low-lying South Dunedin, land which experts say should never have been built upon. The original seawall is evident in this picture, and was made of loose rocks and debris. The current wall is made of concrete and is six metres high. It is a great place to eat fish and chips while watching the pacific ocean hurl itself against the man-made barrier. “We have a duty and responsibility to inform people about what risks they face living in a coastal environment,” says Dr Sharon Hornblow, a natural risks analyst for the Otago Regional Council. “With the issue of sea-level rise we are looking at big storms increasing in frequency and severity...so people that would ordinarily have a fairly low risk of being flooded by the sea may now expect that adverse event to happen every ten years rather than every 100 years.” Thanks for all your comments below the line – it’s great to see so lively a discussion. This, from Uli Nagelb, was interesting in light of earlier debate over reference to “climate deniers” in the US: Earlier in the blog, we referred to “climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word)”; challenged in the comments, my colleague Emily Wilson had this to say: It goes to show how loaded this debate continues to be in the face of apparently indisputable facts. The question of how to bridge the gaps between the two groups remains, as pointed out in this highlighted comment: That’s something that we aim to keep at the forefront of our minds in our coverage of climate change, far beyond singular initiatives such as these. (While it’s great to see the suggestions we keep the blog going for longer, I don’t think Mikey Slezak would be very happy with me for committing to another 24-hour stint – as passionate as he is about rising seawaters.) Last year five islands in the Solomon islands were consumed by rising oceans. The impoverished Oceanic nation, home to 640,000 people, has seen annual sea levels rise by as much as 10mm in the last 20 years; Choiseul Province, home to 20,000 people, was forced to relocate its provincial hub. Fred Patison, the country manager for the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, says residents of Choiseul were attempting to strengthen their ecosystems to reinforce their natural safeguards against climate change. Speaking via Facebook messenger from his office in the capital Honiara, Patison says the Solomons have limited resources, so helping the local people preserve and care for their native forests, reefs and mangroves is the most straightforward action. “Ecosystem-based adaptation” is, for now, affordable and easily communicated – “although at some point relocation may become an option.” He adds that the Solomons were getting uncomfortably hot – a trend noted in other Pacific islands. According to Sydney Aquarium, today is penguin awareness day. As they point out, penguins are threatened by climate change as ice melts and sea level rises. And for your enjoyment, the Australian Antarctic Division have posted this adorable video of penguins being, well, penguins. (And soon we’ll be heading to Antarctica, hearing from a scientist working there right now.) Good morning from Sydney, Australia – my name is Elle Hunt and I’m helping Mikey Slezak co-pilot the blog in its final eight-hour stretch. In the past hour, we’ve learned about: the impact of rising sea levels in the low-lying Pacific island of Kiribati how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now (warning: this carbon countdown clock, updating in real time, may spike your anxiety) the latest on the toxic debate about renewable energy in Australia. The good news: voters aren’t convinced that it’s forcing prices up Coming up, we’ll head to Antarctica with Jason Roberts of the Australian Antarctic Division, who will be joining us for a real-time Q&amp;A from 11am AEDT. Watch his upcoming video interview and let us know what questions you have for him in the comments or on Twitter: I’m @mlle_elle, Mikey’s @MikeySlezak, and the hashtag we’re using is #GlobalWarning. Thanks for joining us. Here in Australia, there’s been a toxic debate about renewable energy. The fossil fuel industry, conservative media and the coalition government have been trying to link blackouts in South Australia, which have been caused by extreme weather, to the high proportion of renewables in that state. They’ve also been arguing that rising power bills around the country are a result of increases in renewable energy in the grid. But today, just as another extreme storm causes a large blackout in South Australia, we have polling from GetUp showing Australians have not been swayed by these arguments. Just over 17% of voters said they thought renewable energy was to blame for rising power prices. Read the full story here: This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. I’ve calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons (CO2-e). You can embed the clock on your own website as well by using the code from the embed button (that’s the purple one with as the symbol). First up, we’re starting in the low-lying island of Kiribati. My colleague Eleanor Ainge Roy has filed this from New Zealand: Kiribati’s climate change officer Choi Yeeting says there are no climate deniers in his island home - because the population of 100,000 people in the central Pacific ocean see the devastating effects of climate change everyday, which in this low-lying atoll nation include rising sea-waters, extensive coastal erosion, increasing temperatures, prolonged droughts and severe fresh water shortages. “Technically speaking, we are planning ahead that one day we may have to leave our home,” said Yeeting. “But on the other side of that is a nationalist pride that comes with being an individual from Kiribati and not wanting to go down without a fight. People are trying to think positively and adapt, because leaving our home is the worst-case scenario.” Former President and renowned climate change activist Anote Tong says when there is a king tide and a moderate westerly wind blowing there is frequent damage to villages and homes, with crops destroyed and fresh water wells tainted. During his time in office (which ended last year), Tong became famous in the climate change community for taking strong, preventative action to prepare his country for the worst, including building sea walls, buying “fall-back” land in Fiji if Kiribati residents were one day forced to migrate, and investigating the feasibility of building a floating island. Tong is adamant that the initial purchase of the land in Fiji was an “investment decision” but since Kiribati’s fate has become more dire, Tong says the Fijian government and its people have stepped forward with open arms. “I have never been in support of our people being given the status of climate refugees. And the reason I say that is we have more than enough time to prepare. And I have always advocated a policy of migration with dignity.” he says. “But the Fiji government and the people have come forward to say Fiji would welcome people from Tuvalu, and Kiribati, if they should ever need a place to go to. And I think that is the moral response that I have been looking for from the international community. So that should be put on record for someone acting in a humanitarian, moral way to a challenge that is going to mean the destruction of homes, culture and people.” Before we move on – a quick update for new readers about what we’re doing here. Just ahead of a climate sceptic moving into the White House, we’re producing 24 hours of reporting on climate change happening now. We began with the blog being piloted from London, and had reporting from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The reins were then taken over by our colleagues in the US, who delivered reporting from the Americas. And here we are now in Australia, bringing you reporting from everywhere between India and Kiribati. It’s not all doom and gloom – we have reports about communities fighting climate change, about reasons to be hopeful and posts about what you can do to help limit global warming. Keep checking back in and let us know what you’re thinking on twitter or below the line. Hello from Sydney, Australia. From the office here, we’re going to drive the blog for the next nine hours, taking it through to the 24 hour mark. As the sun is now moving over the Asia Pacific, we’ll bing you reporting from Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Australia, China, Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia, India and lots of places in between. We’ll also turn to Antarctica, and give you the opportunity to fire questions to a climate scientist who is there now, in the middle of a major research project. You’ll hear from people living on the frontlines of climate change around the region, as well as people at the frontline of the fight against climate change. I’ll be asking some leaders of the climate movement if having a climate denier in the White House, and little progress on climate action in Australia, is a sign the movement is failing. I’ll bring you a video interview with a scientist working on the frontline of climate change in Antarctica – and give you an opportunity to ask him questions for yourself. But we want to hear from YOU. Let me know what’s happening with climate change around you, or how you might be preparing for it or fighting it. Tweet me @mikeyslezak or leave a comment below the line. We’ll try to feature as many of your inputs as we can. As Amanda Holpuch and Ashifa Kassam reported earlier, climate change will have cascading effects from forests in the American south-east to the far reaches of Canada. Brazil’s leading monitor of the Amazon told Jonathan Watts about the threat of cattle ranchers to the Amazon, and attorney Lauren Kurtz told Alan Yuhas about a campaign to help climate scientists protect themselves under the administration of Donald Trump. We’re also going to pass the baton to Michael Slezak and Elle Hunt in Sydney, Austraila, for the final sweep of climate change coverage around the world Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away More from Paulo Barret, head of Imazon, the world’s leading monitor of the Amazon rainforest. It has been argued that indigenous reserves have the best protected forest. Is that true from what you have observed? Indigenous lands and many Conservation Units (such as National Parks and National Forest) are the best protected areas. The indigenous peoples that are more protective are the ones that maintained their ancient livelihoods practices, which are dependent on healthy environment such as hunting, fishing and small scale agriculture. By being present in the areas, they also prevent timber extraction by loggers. Unfortunately, Congress wants to amend the constitution to make it harder to acknowledge land rights for indigenous people. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would review all demarcations of this type by Funai (The National Indian Foundation), which will further politicise the process. What more could be done in Brazil? INPE, the National Space Agency, uses satellite images to report the annual rate of deforestation and also to produce monthly alerts on hotspots of deforestation. Data from the latter – which is named DETER – is provided to the federal environmental agency to guide field inspections. Overall, the system works well, but in the past three years the government stopped publishing DETER’s data to the general public. The new Environment Minister has promised to resume monthly publication. The government should also resume the policies that had been effective including improving enforcement, implement and increase the area of Conservation Units. Additionally, government and private sector should work more on incentives for conservation, especially for small landholders. Finally, government should collect the land tax that would curb speculative deforestation and land grabbing. Looking 20 years into the future, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the Amazon? The best scenario would combine the implementation of policies that have been effective with new ones, such as incentives for conservation, with the aim of keeping the existing forest. But it is also necessary to invest in restoration given that Brazil has an estimated 28 million hectares of legal forest deficit in the whole country – about half of that in the Amazon. However, Brazil has promised to reforest only 12 million hectares up to 2030 as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. The worst scenario would be the continuation of weak government and a private sector that fails to understand the importance of forest conservation to sustainable development and fails to execute their stated commitment to zero deforestation. In that case, deforestation and forest fires would continue and we could lose 30% by 2050. That would take the forest to turning point, after which it could lose the capacity to regenerate due a combination of drier climate and frequent forest fires. Personally, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects for the Amazon? I am very concerned because of the financial and political crises in Brazil that are likely to last for several years. To offset this, the private sector and the international community should increase their support for forest conservation. For example, large corporations that committed to zero-deforestation should work closely with Brazilian authorities and landholders to curb deforestation. The Amazon contains half the world’s remaining rainforest, with an estimated 390bn trees doing the work of storing carbon and regulating the climate. Deforestation is removing those natural air filters. Early this century, an area the size of Albania was being cleared every year. Since then, the good news is that Brazil, which contains 60% of the Amazon, has taken action to slow deforestation. But pressures on the forest are growing again. I asked Paulo Barreto, the head of Imazon, the leading independent Amazon monitoring organisation, to give me an update on the situation. Your organisation uses satellite data to measure deforestation. What do the recent results tell us? The rate of deforestation decreased nearly 80% from 2005 to 2012. But from 2012 to 2016, deforestation rates increased 75% going from 4,571 to 7,989 square kilometres. Can you explain why progress has faltered? Deforestation rates increased because after 2012 Congress and the government weakened the environmental laws by pardoning some of the illegal deforestation, reduced Conservation Units, built large infrastructure project without proper environmental licensing procedures and decreased the enforcement of environmental law. An interactive map by Global Forest Watch tracks the change in forest cover since 2001. It is impressively grim. The pink (decline) areas are far more prominent than the blue (increase) areas. What does this mean for the climate? This means that the Amazon is a large contributor to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases when the forest is burned. In fact, deforestation is responsible for about half of the Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions. Which areas have the most rapid deforestation ? Cattle ranching accounts for 65% of the deforested areas in the Amazon. Deforestation is facilitated by large infrastructure projects, which facilitated transport and attract immigration. In the past five years, this has happened near Belo Monte dam in Altamira and along the BR-163 highway in eastern Pará State and near Porto Velho, Rondônia State, where two dams have been built. On a more positive note, which areas are seeing reforestation ? Most reforestation has been by natural regeneration of forests in abandoned pasturelands. Usually, these lands are in areas with poor potential for land use intensification such as riparian areas or zones with high rainfall. Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to “save” coal mining, holding rallies where he mimed shoveling and accused Barack Obama of doing “everything he can to kill the coal industry”. Surrounded by advisers who oppose climate regulations, Trump will soon be able to hack through the rules put in place by Obama to curtail pollution. Saving coal, however, is likely out of beyond his powers. The free market, far more than regulations, has done the work of killing coal. Despite Trump’s insistence that the US is struggling for energy, the natural gas industry has created a supply glut so significant it has cut deeply into the economies of entire nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia among them. Coal couldn’t compete. Cheaper and cleaner than coal, though – not renewable or green – natural gas operations mushroomed all over the US over the last decade, so much so that they started creating earthquakes and short-lived boomtowns. Trump’s proposals would open up the US for even more gas exploration. Coal only accounts for about 30% of US electricity, down from about 50% in 2008, and its decline traces back several decades. The industry has lost about 200,000 jobs since 1980 as machines replaced humans in the mines, and as those mines delved into deeper, more expensive and dangerous mountains. Exports peaked in 2012, alongside the high points of growth in China, which has its own coal supplies and has now turned toward cleaner energy. Investment banks have also continued to back away from the industry as renewable technology has become cheaper. Clean energy is a hot topic for the political and business bigwigs who gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum this week. The forum has added more sessions on the subject (along with climate change) than ever before. That’s not surprising, given that solar and wind energy no longer represents mostly a badge of environmental activism. We are seeing an increasing number of companies, including Google, Apple and Ikea, that sign contracts to buy renewable electricity or even build their own solar and wind farms. That’s because the prices for these once-expensive sources of energy have dived since 2009, with 63% drop for solar contracts in the US over the past five years. Renewable energy investments, which also include geothermal and biomass, increased from $40.1bn in 2015 to $42.7bn in 2016 in the US, according to a new report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Solar being cheaper than coal? This was once unthinkable. Now, it’s already happening in some corners of the world and could spread to just about everywhere by 2025. Ashifa Kassam, the Guardian’s Canada correspondent this week sent us this dispatch from Lennox Island, off the coast of Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada. On Lennox, she wrote, the island has lost 400 acres in just a few generations and the First Nations community is wondering if it has a future. Kassam reports that over the past three decades, Danny Tuplin has watched the island’s shoreline inch closer to his two-storey house. Only a few years ago, his home sat 10ft from the water. Then in 2004, a hurricane-strength nor’easter blizzard brought the ocean to his doorstep.“I went out the back door, I took five steps and I was in salt water,” said the 58-year-old. Touching on similar issues, we have a comment piece by Julian Brave NoiseCat, an enrolled member of the Canim Lake Band Tsq’escen in British Columbia, who says the cornerstone of the climate justice movement must be indigenous rights and sovereignty. Earlier today we published this piece by Brave NoiesCat in which he writes: “Many believe the fight to combat climate change hinges on the aligned interests of capital and state. Give the Elon Musks of the world enough time and resources and they will innovate us out of impending climate catastrophe. Get the G20 in a room and they will hammer out a deal and create regulations to enforce it. Or so the thinking in some circles goes. Yet throughout history, the interests of the state have slid into alignment with big oil and big profits rather than lining up with our rivers, our air, our wildlife and our people. On Friday, men who disavow climate change and profit mightily from fossil fuels will take charge. In a global race to the bottom, there’s no telling how far downriver these shortsighted profiteers will sell our future generations. Elsewhere on our Comment site today, commissioned for our climate blog, we have a piece by Osprey Orielle Lake, who is marching against Trump on Saturday and argues there is a link between violence against women and the Earth. At the largest gathering of earth scientists in the world last month, a few lawyers had set up a booth stacked with small books for any researcher who would take it: legal advice for how to protect yourself from political persecution. “We’re worried about a lot of things,” said Lauren Kurtz, executive director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, adding that some scientists had received legal and even death threats. “We have people in power who’ve used legal bullying in the past,” she added, alluding to Trump’s history of using expensive lawsuits, or at least the threat of them, to attempt to silence critics. “That sort of legal bullying is going to be seen as much easier to do.” A handful of scientists have already been targeted for their week. Dr Michael Mann, currently a professor at Penn State, was sucked into a long-running legal suit when a rightwing activist group sued the University of Virginia, his former employer, to access tens of thousands of his emails. Scientists at the University of Arizona are currently enmeshed in a similar fight, and last year representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, tried to subpoena scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Their argument is basically if you get the emails you’ll get the full meat of research, whereas it’s actually a way for them to take words out of context.” Barack Obama’s White House defended the climate scientists’ research; scientists now fear that the Trump administration will leave them at the mercy of lawmakers and activists with an interest in silencing scientists. In 2014 a court decided in Mann’s favor, agreeing with him that turning over research emails chilled research; discouraged collaboration; and put scientists at a competitive disadvantage. The Arizona case remains unresolved after a victory by a group funded by several energy companies. Scientists have also come to the legal group with fears for their professional future. They could be barred from grants or lose funding and effectively iced out of their own jobs, Kurtz said. “We worry about government suppression, where scientists can’t do the same research, can’t use the words climate change, modify reports to make it seem like it’s not as drastic as it is.” In turn, she said, the team of attorneys has started to research whistleblower cases, “if and when a scientist comes to us for those sorts of quandaries. A couple have stopped by to say, ‘Hey, I am employed by DOE another one by USGS. I was going to retire and now I’m not going to, because I feel like there’s a need for me to be on the front lines and fight back.’” Much of the data from federal agencies is already public, and some scientists have already begun “guerrilla archiving” to back up the climate data on non-government servers. “Who knows what will happen with the Trump administration,” Kurtz said. “They may do all sorts of back-door things. I don’t think the Trump administration is going to be super pro transparency.” After Donald Trump was elected in November, the mayors of more than 60 US cities sent an open letter to the president-elect urging him to work with them on combating climate change. Trump’s team has yet to respond to the letter, said Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a co-founder of the Mayor’s National Climate Action Agenda. Garcetti, who is in DC for the US Conference of mayors, said he is encouraged by the conversations he’s had this week. “Even a change of administration cannot take away our determination and our ability to continue our progress,” Garcetti said. “Through different administrations and different congresses, most of the action has happened at the local level.” Garcetti said he spoke to the president-elect from the C40 Climate Summit in Mexico City last month. Though he wouldn’t elaborate on details of the conversation, Garcetti described Trump as “open-minded” on the call. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he’s hopeful the Trump administration will respond to the economic case for fighting climate change. “This issue goes a lot deeper than Democrats and Republicans,” Walsh said. “This goes into healthcare. … These issues all of sudden are starting to become economic issues.” Extreme storms, wildfires and droughts, sea level rising and storm surges and air pollution are not just concerns for the mayors of big, liberal cities, Garcetti and Walsh stressed. Climate change is “not an ideological issue but an urgent one for us, that transcends partisanship with undeniable science and more importantly undeniable human impacts”. As climate change causes parts of the earth to grow hotter and drier, it has also led to a recent surge in extremely destructive wildfires. It is difficult to link specific events, like the devastating wildfires in Tennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains last year, directly to climate change, but scientists found that a drier and warmer planet can increase the likelihood of wildfires. “If you get conditions that are ripe for a wildfire across multiple places and at multiple times then wildfires will actually happen,” said Auroop Ganguly, an expert on climate extremes and water sustainability in Northeastern University’s department of civil and environmental engineering. But even as regions become more susceptible to wildfires, there still has to be a trigger, like arson, to start the blaze. Ganguly compared this to a person’s general health: if someone’s all-around health is bad, he explained, that person is more susceptible to other illnesses. That person will also have a more difficult time fighting back against a sickness. Similarly, hotter and drier parts of the globe are more susceptible to wildfires and have a more difficult time responding to it. And scientists say the planet could become more vulnerable to wildfires. Fire season was longer for more than a quarter of the Earth’s surface from 1973 to 2013, according to a July 2015 study published in Nature. The study also found that climatic changes are expected to increase fire season severity in the coming decades. So far, Donald Trump has said extremely little about how he would lead Nasa, whose administrator reports directly to the president, or the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, whose officials report to the secretary of commerce. Late in the campaign, Trump said he hoped to “free Nasa” from its logistics work in low-Earth orbit (which Nasa does little of) and instead “refocus its mission on space exploration”. “Did you ever see what’s going on with space, with Russia and different places? And us? We’re, like, we’re like watching. Isn’t that nice? So much is learned from that, too.” The main suggestion of Trump’s speech, alongside his repeated denial and skepticism toward the science of global warming, is that he intends to cut Nasa’s Earth science work. Bob Walker, an adviser to the president-elect, has pushed the idea of cutting all of Nasa’s climate research in favor of deep space exploration. Climate scientists have warned this would prove a savage blow to research efforts. Trump’s nominee for secretary of commerce is billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who has not commented at all about how he would lead Noaa, protect US fisheries or guide climate science. Ross made his fortune, in part, by rehabilitating steel and coal companies. Trump has not said who he would name Noaa’s administrator; Obama’s first pick for the post was marine ecologist Jane Lubchenco. The current administrator of Nasa, former astronaut Charles Bolden, is expected to follow tradition for appointees when a new president takes the White House, and submit his resignation shortly after Trump is inaugurated. Though Nasa has generally enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, it has a $2bn Earth science program that many scientists fear will suffer greatly under a Republican government stocked with many climate change skeptics and deniers. The space agency’s planetary science programs may go untouched, but scientists also fear that funding will stagnate as Congress enacts new tax cuts and grapples with how to reconcile those with hugely expensive efforts to repeal healthcare reform and spend on infrastructure. Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa’s new associate administrator told reporters last month that he stands by the priorities and data he prepared for the incoming administration. “The principles we drew out are the principles that we would use in any administration,” he said, adding that he urged scientists to “focus on the data that we get and not amplify the noise.” “Behave like scientists, and talk like scientists, passionately,” he continued. “Talk about science in away we know that’s affecting life on earth.” As Ucilia Wang and Jonathan Watts reported earlier, climate change will affect just about every detail of daiy life, from your morning coffee to chocolate to a glass of wine. Later on we’ll hear how this increasing aridity is going to affect your meal – breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. We’re also going to hear about the steps climate scientists can take to defend themselves in the age of Trump Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Renewable energy has long been considered a liberal cause championed by tree huggers on the ground and Democrats in governments. That political divide showed up in election campaign contributions historically as well. But during the 2016 election cycle, the solar and wind trade groups gave more money to Republicans than Democrats running for federal offices for the first time, reported Reuters. Their bets may pay off as they face a new administration with a new president who thinks solar and wind are expensive and sees wind turbines as bird killers that also ruin views of his golf courses. Roughly $400,000 from wind and solar political action committees (Pac) went to dozens of federal election candidates. Among the Republicans are Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Representative Tom Reed of New York and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who together received more than 40% of the federal campaign contributions from the Solar Energy Industries Association Pac. That shift in money politics reflects the reality that many red states are home to large solar and wind farms. Take a look at the top 10 states with the most solar energy generation and you will find Arizona, North Carolina and Texas on the list. The top wind energy states include Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa. Lobbying across political lines also makes sense because the country’s energy market is made up of more than 3,000 utilities and regulated mostly by states. Local politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, are particularly keen to support businesses that bring jobs and tax revenues. Encroaching into homes and dinner tables, rich and poor alike, climate change plays no favorites – it will take your chocolate. Cacao trees grow in rainforest climates that will only become drier in the next few decades, depriving the plants of the large amounts of water they need to grow. Research collated by Noaa and the IPCC suggests that climate change will force the best land for growing chocolate into higher altitudes, creating a slew of conflicts for farmers and industries, especially in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, where a huge amount of the world’s cacao is grown. Over the last 40 years, the world’s available land for cocoa growth has declined 40%; the temperature in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire is expected to rise two degrees Celsius over the next 40. Growers in some regions are trying to breed drought-resistant plants to survive the worsening conditions, while others are replanting sections of rainforest to mimic cacao’s natural habitats, in a method called cabruca in Brazil. Coffee will fare even worse than cacao, suffering from the increasing heat as well as the aridity, and beer production, reliant on a large amount of water for processing hops, has already been affected at dozens of breweries. Climate change has already encroached into grocery stores and restaurant menus, as it kills crops and makes it harder to keep fruit, vegetables and livestock alive. Global warming is also draining our drinks, including one of the oldest human libations: wine. A warming climate will affect the quality and yield of the grapes, with mixed results around the world. Rising temperatures could help growers in some regions, for instance helping France in particular grow premium grapes. But the same can’t be said for California, the biggest wine producing state in the country. Rising temperatures, coupled with persistent drought and the likelihood of more extreme hot and wet days ahead, are gradually making the state less habitable for its notable varietals, including chardonnay and cabernet. Grape growers have been taking note of the effect of global warming. How they deal with it will influence the role the US is the global wine industry, where the country is among the top five wine grape growing and wine-producing nations. Some vintners are using technology to help them cope. For example, they are using sensors and drones to monitor soil quality and planting more cover crops to retain moisture in the ground. They are turning to owls and falcons to fight the growing army of pests such as mice and voles. They are also recycling the precious water more, in some cases relying on giant bins of earthworms to do the job. In London, the live panel debate is underway off at Guardian headquarters. A room full of members, readers and activists joins host Mark Rice-Oxley, the actor and entrepreneur, Lily Cole, the author and academic, Dr Jonathan Rowson, and the Green party’s science and technology spokesperson, Esther Obiri-Darko. Also on the panel are the chief executive of Friends of the Earth, Craig Bennett and the “renegade economist” Kate Raworth. Opening the debate, the panel members discussed how to be about the political and economic change necessary to protect the environment. Cole told the audience that the most effective option for individuals was to vote with their wallets. One of the main areas I’ve focused on is how I spend my money. I’m not perfect with it, I’m as guilty as most westerners of buying too much... But, because the world is so driven by economics and so driven by money right now, the only way you’re going to communicate to businesses is by starving their bottom line. Obiri-Darko added that such a change needed a combination of “people power” and government accountability; saying that one or the other alone would not bring it about. She said that, where she knocks on doors in south west London, air pollution was a major concern and only when climate change began to affect people would they start to demand action from their elected officials. Raworth cited Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign as an example of what she characterised as an obsession with growth at the expense of other issues, such as the protection of the environment. Rowson agreed that Trump has an “old-fashioned economic mindset” and his election was unlikely to be helpful to those who sought to fight climate change. But he said, looking at the bigger picture, the election of a US president - possibly only for four years - should not been seen as a catastrophic event, adding that Trump can be influenced because of the extent to which he cares about his esteem. Bennett agreed that there was cause for optimism, arguing that movements have never brought about major societal changes unopposed. It was only when the campaigns to abolish slavery were doing really well that the pro-slavery movement formed. They said ‘this will harm my competitiveness, we can’t possibly afford this, it’s going to cost jobs’. Almost identical arguments to those used now by people campaigning against action on climate change. The cup of coffee that millions of us woke up with this morning was more likely to have come from Brazil than another nation. But this ritual will become rarer and more expensive, according to forecasts that climate change will cut the bean-growing belt by half here and across the world over the next 35 years. Drought and rising average temperatures are already a growing worry for farmers such as Maria Assunção da Silva, whose family has grown coffee in Minas Gerais since the 19th century. The business has rarely been tougher than in the past four years. In 2013, the drought was so severe the beans formed as empty husks. Since then, he says, the weather has been destructively unpredictable. It has been dry in the usual rainy season, which results in smaller beans. In the usual dry season, it rains, which makes it difficult to process the harvest. “What we have been seeing in these past years has been hindering our production,” Silva says. Others have fared worse. In Espirito Santo recently, the worst drought in 80 years forced farmers to dig up thousands of arid robusta coffee trees and switch to alternative crops. Warehouses in the region were down to a quarter of their capacity. Exports of conilon, a variety of robusta, fell 90%. With prospects poor for this year, many warehouses are expected to close. Growers say the weather is becoming more erratic and extreme. São Paulo’s coffee producers suffered dire water shortages in 2015, but when the rains finally came, it was often in intense downpours that led to flood damage. While the main temperature trend is of warming, some crops were hit by frost in freakish cold spells last winter - in the middle of the hottest year ever recorded in the world. “What is certain is that the weather is more unstable and unpredictable,” noted agronomy engineer and coffee farmer, Pedro Ronca. Overall, improved production techniques and well-timed rains for the main arabica crop ensured a good national harvest and a stabilisation of prices. But scientists and environmental groups warn the situation will become more difficult in the years ahead in Brazil and other coffee-producing nations. “Increasing temperatures and extreme weather events will cut the area (in the world) suitable for production by up to 50%, erode coffee quality, and increase coffee prices for consumers,” predicted a Climate Institute study last year. Earlier research by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, suggested none of the current coffee producing regions in Brazil would have the ideal conditions (average temperatures of 18-22C, ample rain and no frost) by 2080. “Once full climate change effects are experienced, Brazil may face challenges to remain a major coffee producing country,” the authors noted. This grim scenario is far from inevitable. As well as global efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change, Brazilian officials, scientists and farmers are moving to adapt. Eduardo Assad, of the government’s agriculture research institute Embrapa, believes there is considerable potential to move coffee production to the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. Currently that is not feasible due to frost, but this risk will decline if temperatures rise by 2C. Even so, this would require huge disruption to Brazil’s agriculture, particularly to coffee farmers who usually require 15 to 20 years for a return on their investment. For now, most would rather stay put and use technology and chemicals to cope with rising climate challenges. Silva is investing in a coffee drier because he cannot depend on the sun, more anti-fungicide chemicals because the risks from unseasonal rain have increased, and to counter the rising temperatures he is planting new heat-resistant varieties of coffee and insulating the soil with straw. “We don’t think the weather conditions will improve, so we are trying to adapt to the new climate variation,” he says. Such measures push up his costs and the global value of beans, but, if the forecasts are correct, it is only the start of the rise in price that we will all pay for our morning cup of coffee As Jonathan Watts reported earlier, the end of the world is looking not just warm but dry, from the mountainous lakes of South America up to the disappearing snowpacks of California.

There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Michael Ingui, an architect at Baxt Ingui Architects, specializes in creating passive houses – “super-insulated houses that use a fraction of the energy” of a traditional home. Passive houses use much less energy than a traditional home due to a by using superior insulation, special triple-glazed windows and an energy recovery ventilator which filters in fresh air and releases stale air. The ventilator is used to heat the house, which means no radiators and no boiler. It also means significantly less energy costs: Ingui estimates his passive houses save “80-90%” on energy bills. “The way I would really describe it is: a passive house is just a better building,” Ingui said. “It can also heat and cool itself passively, without any mechanical elements.” The walls of a passive house are much thickerthan a normal home due to the extra insulation, which Ingui described as forming an “envelope” in which any gaps that may exist in a traditional home are completely sealed. Ingui has designed and fitted out seven in the past four years, and is working on three more. Some of those homes – including the one I looked around in Brooklyn on Thursday – have solar panels on the roof, which means they can effectively be carbon zero. … We have a small favour to ask.

What happens in Antarctica does not stay there: the icy waters off the southernmost continent are an engine for life around the world, and they are warming faster than anywhere else – a threat to the global food supply. For decades, scientists have been diving underneath the quickly melting ice in a race to learn the consequences of warming on the ecosystem. For six years of increasingly withering heat, Californians have rationed resources, fought with celebrities and watched as precious reservoirs and snowpacks, so important to the state’s economy and daily lives of its residents, disappeared to historic lows. When it rained, it was never enough – though hope has partially returned with massive storms of the last three weeks. According to the US Drought Monitor, about 42% of the state is out of drought, thanks to a series of heavy rains around the Bay area and blizzards over part of the Sierra Nevada, where snowpack provides critical water for the state in the spring and summer. The heavy rains also replenished the state’s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta, back to 82%, and even Los Angeles saw flash flood warnings as storms stretched across the state. But southern California has not enjoyed as much of a deluge as the north. Santa Barbara’s Lake Cachuma holds only about 8% of its capacity. New Melones Lake, in central California, holds only about 60% of its historical average, and some residents in the region need bottled water to drink and cook. Jay Lund, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California Davis, warned that the drought will leave scars that may last decades. The state may have to keep paying for expensive water pumping for years, and in the Central Valley some aquifers “might never recover to pre-drought levels”, he wrote in a blog post. “Drought damage to California’s forests could require decades to recover, or, if higher temperatures persist, the ecology of many forests might shift to new normal condition,” he added. “Native fish also will likely need years to recover – with impediments from already depleted numbers and highly disrupted and altered ecosystems.” Lund said that the state’s leaders need to accept that the drought is not permanent, but that California is “a dry place with permanent water shortages (except in unusual wet years)”. Over on Tumblr, we’ve been running a blog collecting young people’s experiences, hopes and fears on climate change. You can submit your own messages or artwork here. We’ll be highlighting some of the posts throughout the day. The end of the world is dry. That is not a prophesy of doom, but an increasingly evident fact as I learned during a recent trip to Patagonia. I visited in October, revelling in the immensity of the region (which is four times the area of the United Kingdom), zagging back and forth between its Chilean and Argentinian sides, delighting in spectacular mountain and grassland scenery, and taking a dark pleasure in the road signs telling me I was on the “Ruta del Fin del Mundo”, a geographic reference to this southernmost tip of the Americas rather than a reminder of imminent apocalypse. I also spent a lot of time skimming stones across lakes - a childhood pastime given a fresh boost by the incredible scenery, the glasslike surface of tarns in the Torres del Paine, warm weather and the discovery of a slow-mo feature on my cellphone video camera. Much as I enjoyed this activity, it also reminded me of the damage being done by rising temperatures and declining rainfall. Lakes formed by glacier melt were full. Many others had dried up completely, destroying fish habitats and drinking sources for jaguars, guanacos and ema. This wasn’t restricted to Torres del Paine. Five hundred miles further further south, I saw pink flamingos flapping their way across a half empty body of water and, then, another 15 minutes along the road, a fox crossing through the dust of a white alkaline lake bed that had been completely exposed to the wind. Over the course of the weeklong trip, I lost count of the lakes that had evaporated. After I returned home, I did a little research on whether this was merely seasonal or a sign of a longer-term climactic shift. Climate scientists believe the world’s extremities, the poles and mountains ranges, are warming faster than elsewhere, which means Patagonia is particularly vulnerable because both its latitude and altitude are high. Shin Sugiyama, a researcher at the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University, confirmed the region’s glaciers were declining faster than those in other mountain ranges. Andrés Rivera, a Senior Researcher of the Glaciology Laboratory at the Centre for Scientific Studies in Valdivia in Chile, noted how the recent dry period in the region has contributed to rising snow-lines and a loss of lake volumes. Eric Rignot, professor of Earth System Science at the University of California, said the glacier melt and lack of precipitation were likely to have been affected by the ebbing of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), a belt of Antarctic low pressure that normally brings snow and ice to Patagonia. Research from other scientists say SAM is at its weakest ebb in 1,000 years, due in part to to increasing greenhouse gas levels. The consequences are not sudden. Rather they are of steadily increasing severity. Chilean newspapers have reported the worst drought in Patagonia since records began, after seven consecutive years of unusually low snowfall, short winters and hot summers. In Argentina, this is blamed for the deaths of 1.8m sheep, or 12% of the national flock. The earlier stage of this prolonged drought has also left a black mark on the landscape in the form of thousands of charred stumps from the huge forest fire that tore through Torres del Paine In 2011. That was started by careless tourists and spread out of control because trees and brush were unusually dry. Despite it all, Patagonia is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. I would certainly love to go back, explore remote glaciers, marvel at the other worldly skyscapes and, of course, skim more stones. How many lakes, though, will be left? As Lauren Gambino reported earlier, mayors in US cities are making plans to fight climate change themselves if they have to. Later on we’ll also hear how the financial rewards – the money that can be made in renewables – also holds out hope for the future even if our political leaders fail us. We’re also going to hear about how drought is impacting California and Latin America. Fifteen things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away New York City and the wider state are embracing renewable energy as the state’s leaders take steps to resist Donald Trump’s rollback of green initiatives. The Atelier Condo, a 47-story, 478-unit residential building in Hell’s Kitchen, for instance, installed about 3,000-square-feet of solar panelling in 2011. Daniel Neiditch, president of the Atelier and of real estate company River 2 River Realty, said that after rebates from the city and state, the investment cost $70,000. Nieditch said he earned that much back in savings after a year-and-a-half. He estimates currently provide almost 10% of the building’s energy. “There’s no way you can do solar and not save money over time,” Neiditch said. “It’s a no brainer.” New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 80% by 2050 and both local and state incentives can cut the cost of solar panel installation by 50%. Neiditch said some developers don’t realise how quickly they will make their money back, or what kind of rebates are available in their state. “There’s so much more that can be done,” Neiditch said. He said developers “need to be educated” on the benefits – possibly by the city or state. The Atelier will be fitted with another 6,000 sq-ft of solar panels this summer, Neiditch said, which could mean solar accounts for 25% of the buildings electricity, saving $200,000 a year. This morning the Guardian caught up with a couple of big city mayors to discuss their concerns about the incoming administration’s climate change agenda. The takeaway: who needs Washington? Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Boston mayor Marty Walsh said the real change is happening at the local level and federal action, er inaction, won’t change that. “Don’t get in our way,” Garcetti said, describing his message to an administration that is hostile to efforts to curb climate change at the federal level. Trump has threatened to pull out of the international Paris agreement and said he would dismantle Obama’s Clean Power Plan, as well as other initiatives taken by the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has nominated Kansas attorney general Scott Pruitt to head up the EPA, the agency he is currently suing. “We’re prepared, if we withdraw from Paris, to enact Paris at the local level,” Garcetti told a handful of journalists at the Hilton Continental Hotel in Washington. “Worst-case scenario, the federal government can probably take away 20% or 30% of our progress, and I’d rather have 100% than 70% or 80%, but I feel like that 70 to 80% of further progress is inevitable based on the leadership that we’ve already shown.” Much of the international fretting over the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the US presidency is focused on the real estate magnate’s pledge to “cancel” the Paris climate deal. Tearing up a central plank of Barack Obama’s climate legacy by removing America from the agreement would cause shockwaves that could badly damage the global climate effort. But will that actually happen? Currently, every functioning government in the world is signed up the Paris goal of limiting global warming to a 2C increase on pre-industrial times. Chinese president Xi Jingping, in a veiled jab at Trump this week, warned that “we must ensure this endeavor is not derailed.” Similar diplomatic pressure is likely to come from other nations once Trump is in the White House. Quitting the Paris accord would take a three-year notice period. A quicker way would be to exit the UN climate body itself, which would take just a year. Such a move would likely cause other countries to question why they should make the effort to cut emissions if the US, historically the world’s largest emitter, can’t be bothered. The latter option appears unlikely, for now at least. Shortly after his election win, Trump said that he in fact has an “open mind” to the Paris deal. And then Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, played down the prospect of complete US withdrawal last week: I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response. Perhaps the most likely outcome is ostensible US involvement in the UN climate process but with little effort to provide the climate funding or emissions reduction goals demanded by the Paris deal. Whether the Trump administration will be openly disruptive or sullen during talks remains to be seen. “It isn’t clear whether his ‘seat at the table’ will be a good dinner guest or the drunk uncle,” said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. In partnership with the Guardian, Univision Noticias is highlighting the urgency of climate action around the world. Join Univision and Fusion environmental correspondent Nicolás Ibargüen as he discusses on Facebook Live. We’ve heard from Jonathan Watts how experts in Brazil are anxious at the indigenous territories and fears there around a government move to change how their land is demarcated. We’ll have more on this theme later. 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Shortly we’ll have live video from our partners Univision in Miami. Before that, its worth reflecting that Trump has a home in Florida which he regularly spends time at. Mar-a-Lago mansion began as a cereal heiress’ dream of a presidential retreat on a south Florida beach. The children of its current occupant, President-elect Donald Trump, may live to see the ocean sweep over the tennis courts, up across the long, and up to the mansion’s front door. Whether the next president accepts science or not, climate change is on course to turn his beloved resort into something closer to Atlantis than the winter White House. By 2045, a relatively weak category-two hurricane would bring the ocean up to main building of the resort, a risk consulting firm found last year. Two other Trump properties, in Hollywood and Sunny Isles, could be cut off from roads and even made temporary islands by tidal floods. Just over an hour the south, Miami is already at war with the ocean, as tides floods increasingly sweep floods into the streets and homes, swamping condo lobbies and cutting off islands and bridges. The rate of sea-level rise has tripled over the last 10 years, according to a University of Miami study. City leaders have budgeted $400m to install dozens of water pumps around the city and to raise the height of roads and seawalls, but the state remains divided: real estate developers continue to build expensive condos, and the governor insists on skepticism toward science. The tides, meanwhile, continue to seep up through Florida’s porous limestone ground, threatening to destroy homes and seeping sewage into drinking water. By some researchers’ predictions, parts of south Florida appear already lost, and swaths of the state will be underwater by 2025. 2016 was the warmest year, globally, on record and the second warmest year on record in the US, following the long-term warming trend. As Trump assumes the presidency, there are signs that these numbers are starting to translate into tangible consequences for Americans: There are now Americans displaced due to climate change, from Louisiana to Alaska. Several Alaskan towns are set to be relocated – last year warmer than normal days outnumbered cooler than normal days in the state by a ratio of nine to one. Of the 10 global cities deemed by the World Bank at most risk from sea level rise, five are in the US – New York, Boston, New Orleans, Tampa and Miami. The north-east of the US is warming faster than the global average and the sea level is rising more quickly too. New research, published in Nature, shows that crop harvests in the US are likely to shrink by as much as a half due to rising temperatures. States such as California, already stricken by drought, are likely to face huge “megadroughts” in the future. Last year there were 15 climate-related disasters in the US that cost more than $1bn in damages. A total of 138 lives were lost. The severity of hurricanes and floods is likely to increase in parts of the US. There has been a four-fold increase in the number of large, lengthy forest fires in the American west over the past 30 years. While Trump may be unconcerned over the impact of climate change, the period of his presidency is likely to involve further signs that Americans are at risk. In response, Trump has so far promised to gut climate and clean energy spending, withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal and attempt to kickstart the ailing coal industry. Public realization of scientists’ warnings has been illustrated by the latest polling by Yale University. In November, Yale found that one in five Americans are “very worried” about climate change – the highest proportion yet recorded. 4) Where are the public on this issue? Is there is an ideological dividing line as in the US, or is there a broad consensus about the science? In 2015, 28% of Brazilian municipalities entered into emergency or calamity due to extreme weather – droughts, floods, storms, landslides. This affected millions of people so that are aware things are changing. We don’t face the same debate as the US about whether climate change is related to human activities. Last year, the Paris climate treaty was ratified easily despite our political crisis. Even the most conservative members on the political spectrum, the debate is more about what we do about climate change. Some say Brazil has already made the biggest contribution through deforestation reduction and renewables, which account for a little more than 70% of electricity generation and 40% of the total energy mix. The question is whether to do more. But unfortunately, climate change is not a priority for this government, as it wasn’t for the previous one. It is seen as an environmental issue, not a development issue. 5) What does this mean in concrete terms? The past two years have seen a 60% rise in deforestation. Considering what is going on now in congress, we could see a new era of deforestation in Brazil. It is very alarming. We could be returning to the bad days of more than 10,000 square km of clearance each year. 6) How might climate policy be affected by the 2018 presidential election? I don’t think Brazil can elect someone like Trump who denies climate change, but we could have someone with very conservative ideas who sees the environment as an obstacle for development. They might argue that if US is doing nothing on climate, why should we? But one of the candidates will be former environment minister Marina Silva, who will ensure that sustainable development and climate policy are part of the debate. It’s too early though to say who might win. We don’t know who will run and what will be the impact of the ongoing corruption investigation (intro bribery at the state oil firm Petrobras). But the result will be important. The next president is the one who will have to deliver results because after 2020 Brazil’s commitments become obligations. 7) Given the current trends, are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future? I’m not too gloomy, but Brazil is a country of lost opportunities. Every year, there are more groups who see forests and the environment as obstacles to development. But there are good signs too. There is room in the private sector for discussing climate change as an opportunity for Brazil to benefit from our natural capital. We need a more efficient agriculture and more renewable energy – biofuels, bio energy, wind, solar and hydro. Why not make the most of these competitive advantages? The economic benefits of climate action are huge. We are trying to make this a priority for the next president. But it won’t be easy. If the world is to get emissions under control, Brazil will be a key player. Over the past decade, it has played a mostly positive role, both in taking domestic action to reduce the rate of deforestation of the Amazon, and also in constructive diplomacy in international climate talks. But economic recession and political turmoil have led many to fear this might change in the future. For an insight into what might come next, I approached Carlos Rittl, associate researcher of the Brazilian Climate Observator, an umbrella organisation that represents more than 40 environment NGOs. Here’s our Q&amp;A: 1) Yesterday, the Brazilian justice ministry changed the rules for demarcating indigenous land. What is your take on this? This is really, really bad. It is the most negative change made in environmental and climate policy since the government of (Michel) Temer took power last year. Indigenous territories are critical for Brazil’s climate resilience. This new move threatens even already demarcated lands, yet the justice ministry moved ahead without any public debate, any discussion with the people affected. It shows what a myopic view the new government has when it comes to land use. 2) How else has climate policy changed since the switch of government from the centre-left administration of Dilma Rousseff to the centre-right administration of Michel Temer? In terms of Brazil’s goals, there has been no change. But there has been a shift in attitude that could affect whether those targets are achieved. There are many proposals that are bad for the climate. The administration wants to soften environmental legislation and reduce protected areas. Before Temer came to power, he outlined his approach in a document called Bridge to the Future. It contained no reference to climate or renewables. The only reference to the environment was a promise to weaken the environmental licensing process. 3) One of the reasons for the political shift has been the rise of the agribusiness and evangelical lobbies in congress. What are their goals when it comes to climate policy? There is a danger that Brazil’s climate policy could shift backwards. Agribusiness presents itself as the solution to current economic crisis. They say they need more investment and more support and changes to land policy. The decision made by the ministry of justice yesterday is connected to that. They also want to prevent agribusinesses from having to do annual environmental licensing renewals. They want approval for mining in indigenous territories and protected areas. They are also pushing for more infrastructure to make their business easier. For example on the Tapajos river, they don’t just want more dams, but also waterways so soy can be shipped from central Brazil to Europe. All this will make it more difficult for Brazil to deliver on its 2020 climate goals. They are also trying to remove the environment minister from his post because he is trying to do his job. Over the next few hours we’ll also be hearing from our Latin American correspondent, Jonathan Watts. First up he’s been speaking to a key expert in Brazil, a key country. Later we’ll hear about his trip to Patagonia, and how climate change is affecting something a lot of people hold dear: coffee. Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is the outgoing chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant under investigation for possibly defrauding investors about what it knew and did about climate change. Shortly after Barack Obama’s election in 2009, Tillerson announced his support for a carbon tax – if only because he considers it preferable to cap and trade policies – but environmental groups have denounced Tillerson’s nomination. Tillerson does not deny that climate change is real, but in a hearing with Congress last week refused to answer a question about whether ExxonMobil had tried to sow doubt about the science. Tillerson told Senator Tim Kaine, “I’m in no position to speak” for his company’s executives, until the frustrated congressman asked, “Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or are you refusing to do so?” “A little of both,” Tillerson answered. Tillerson also rejected the Pentagon’s warning that climate change is a national security risk and would only say the US will “keep a seat at the table” in the international effort to curb global warming. Trump has previously promised to quit the Paris climate deal. As we’ve pointed out in the previous post, Obama’s legacy is far from perfect. But it’s fair to say there are greater fears around the Trump administration’s key cabinet posts relating to climate change. Alan Yuhas is about to post on the pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Also ahead we’ll have more video from New York’s rooftops. Highlights: 15 things you can do to make a difference Adam Gabbatt on New York’s rooftop solar farms George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Barack Obama has banned drilling in the Arctic, fought to reduce pollution and power plant emissions, and preserved more marine territory than any previous president. Yet researchers at Columbia University say that his legacy is tarnished by the work of the US Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that has handed out nearly $34bn of taxpayer-funded loans to corporations and foreign governments for fossil-fuel projects. The team at Columbia collaborated with the Guardian last year on a report that showed how Obama’s the obscure agency within his own administration quietly spoiled his record by helping fund a steady outpouring of new overseas fossil fuel emissions – effectively erasing gains expected from his headline clean power plan or fuel efficiency standards. Since January 2009, the US Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad. Here’s a video we made about Obama’s climate change legacy. As Rick Perry’s rather polite confirmation hearing rolls on, it’s worth recalling the more combative hearing faced by Scott Pruitt yesterday. Pruitt is Trump’s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA was founded by a Republican administration with a mission to keep America’s water clean, its air free of toxic pollution, and help towns around the country keep their fields, roads and rivers safe. Pruitt has used his post as Oklahoma’s attorney general to sue the EPA 14 times in seven years, 13 in alliances with energy, agriculture and other large corporations. Pruitt, 48, is the first pick for EPA administrator opposed by the Environmental Defense Fund since Richard Nixon founded the federal agency in 1970, and has received more than $300,000 in campaign donations from executives at poultry and oil corporations. Other environmental groups have called Pruitt a “puppet” of oil and gas companies, noting that in 2014 he fought regulations with a letter written by Devon Energy. In another case unearthed by the New York Times, Pruitt stopped a legal fight between towns and poultry companies whose tons of chicken manure were poisoning water in north-eastern Oklahoma. If confirmed, Pruitt will likely try to dismantle Barack Obama’s work on climate change, with the Clean Power Plan his most obvious target. The plan is currently on hold in the courts, due to a suit brought by 27 Republican-led states to stop it. Pruitt has also doubted the evidence of climate change in general, claiming in May that – although 2016 proved to break yet more records for temperature and sea ice, and that nearly all scientists agree the world is warming dangerously – the “debate is far from settled”. In his home state of Oklahoma, where Pruitt has fought to keep hydraulic fracking as unregulated as possible, scientists have linked fracking to an extraordinary increase in earthquakes. Oklahomans are now as likely to feel an earthquake as Californians. One of the themes we are looking at is how the impact of climate change does not affect everyone equally. On Comment, we’ve just launched a piece from Elizabeth C Yeampierre, the executive director of Uprose, an organization that fights for environmental justice. She writes: “When things are bad for everyone, they are particularly bad for people of color. The Trump administration is about to legitimize injustice in all of our communities. People of color have endured the extraction of our land and labor – and its legacy – since the creation of these United States. Now, we are bracing ourselves for worse things to come.” Read the full comment piece here Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is currently facing questions from US senators in his confirmation hearing as Donald Trump’s secretary of energy. Perry rather sheepishly told the senators that he regrets calling for the department of energy to be scrapped. Famously, Perry ran for president in 2012 only to call for the abolition of three government departments in a televised debate. The problem was he couldn’t remember the name of the third agency – energy – leading him to flounder briefly and then mutter “oops”. Maria Cantwell, a Democratic senator on the energy committee, couldn’t resist: “I suspect now, having a chance to learn about the importance of this department, you have a very different opinion.” Perry conceded he may have been a little hasty. “After being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination,” he told the committee. The Department of Energy maintains America’s nuclear arsenal, cleans up nuclear waste and undertakes research in a number of areas, including climate change. The Trump transition team raised alarm by sending out a questionnaire that asked for names of scientists who have worked on climate research. Perry said he didn’t approve of the request and promised the committee that he wouldn’t target climate scientists or eviscerate their work. Perry did confirm, however, he supports Trump’s “America first” energy strategy (which means lots of drilling for oil and gas) and it doesn’t sound like he will be bending the president’s ear over the urgency of global warming. He told the committee: I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by manmade activity. The question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy, or American jobs. This sort of equivocation has become familiar during these confirmation hearings. Both Rex Tillerson, Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and Scott Pruitt, his choice for the Environmental Protection Agency, have said they accept the climate is changing but have voiced doubts over the extent of human culpability for this. Scientists, on the other hand, are pretty clear on this point – the world is warming due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. We’ve picked up the climate blog in the US, and have heard from outgoing EPA boss Gina McCarthy who says staff there are nervous about the incoming administration’s attitude to science and climate change. We’ve also published the first of our three videos from solar panel clad buildings in New York City. Coming up later we also have a live video from our partners Univision who are blogging live in Spanish today on climate change. At around 1pm ET (6pm GMT) we’ll host a live video report from them in Miami on the climate change threat. Miami is just one of the places on the US coast already being impacted by rising sea levels. Highlights of our blog so far include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot: ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away Brooklyn Navy Yard, a huge industrial park located across the water from Manhattan in New York City, installed a 3,152 solar panel field on top of one of its buildings in September. The yard, which is home to 300 businesses with 7,000 employees, expects to generate 1.1m kilowatt hours of energy each year – which it says is the equivalent of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.4m pounds and saving 76,000 gallons of gasoline each year. The panels cover an area bigger than a football field on the top of a warehouse close to the East river, overlooking downtown Manhattan. “Sustainability has long been a core corporate value of ours,” said Clare Newman, chief of staff and executive vice-president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard corporation. “And our tenants and our businesses really care about and embody the same values.” The project was paid for by Con Ed solutions, a subsidiary of the larger Con Ed energy company. Con Ed solutions secured $625,863.83 in incentives from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which promotes energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. We’re looking at all of the issues around climate change – including the solutions. And both New York City – and the wider state – are among the trailblazers in the US when it comes to solar power. In New York City there are thousands of buildings which have been fitted with solar panels. During the US hours of our climate change blog, we’ll have three videos for you from Adam Gabbatt, who we sent to the top of skyscrapers and other buildings in the city to find out how they make that work. One of the big areas of concern around the incoming Trump administration is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We’ve published a story earlier Thursday on an interview with the agency’s outgoing administrator, Gina McCarthy. She told me that there is “nervousness” among EPA staff that Trump’s incoming administration will sideline science and reverse action on climate change. McCarthy told the Guardian that the Trump administration would face resistance from multiple fronts if it ran counter to a widespread shift to renewable energy, as well as scientific opinion, by rejecting climate science and attempting to bolster the fossil fuel industry. Trump has promised to reduce the EPA to “tidbits” and has nominated the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to run the agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA 14 times over its pollution regulations, has questioned established climate science and has been criticized by environment groups for his ties to oil and gas interests. “People at the EPA will be respectful of the new administration but they will continue to do their jobs,” said McCarthy, who was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 to head the regulator. “I would not be telling the truth if I said there was no sense of nervousness. There is a sense of nervousness that the new administration will take decisions not in line with the science. Read more of the interview with McCarthy here. Hello and welcome to the American portion of our climate blog, on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration. Oliver Milman in New York and Alan Yuhas in San Francisco will see you through. The new president will forever be reminded of his tweet that claimed that global warming “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. But that conspiracy theory was expounded four years ago now and Trump’s attitude to climate change, like much else, has wobbled in the wind. Where once climate science was apparently just an excuse for a “very, very expensive form of tax”, Trump conceded in November there may in fact be “some connectivity” between human activity and warming. On the campaign trail Trump promised to “cancel” the Paris climate deal but now Rex Tillerson, his choice for secretary of state, insists that the US will still have a “seat at the table” in climate talks. Climate change may be the defining challenge of our time, but the response of the world’s superpower remains clouded in doubt just a day before its new president takes power. Trump has been consistent, however, in his steadfast support for fossil fuels, even donning a miner’s helmet during a rally in West Virginia to promise – in the face of economic reality – that coal mining jobs will return. Environmental groups fear the worst – emissions reduction plans trashed, climate funding scrapped, scientists harassed or muzzled and a vacuum of international leadership that may encourage other countries to ease off their own efforts. Trump’s cabinet picks will be key and the signs are ominous. Incredibly, Tillerson, former chief executive of ExxonMobil, the oil giant that actively suppressed its own knowledge of climate change for decades, may be the one most in line with mainstream science. Trump’s nominations for the Environmental Protection Agency and the department of interior, to name just two, have raised doubts over whether humans really are influencing the climate and have been showered in donations from polluters. We will look at each of these cabinet picks, as well as outline some of the key climate issues facing the Trump presidency. The next four years could well see havoc from severe storms, rising seas, scorching heatwaves and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Pertinently for Trump, these calamities could just as likely occur in the US as some far-flung country. Even his own resort at Mar-a-Lago in Florida could be at risk. A response beyond blaming the Chinese will be required. So that’s about it from this part of the world. We are off for a lie down in a dark room. Stay tuned though for much, much more from the Americas, hosted by Oliver Milman and Alan Yuhas. For anyone just tuning in, highlights of this blog so far today include: 15 things you can do to make a difference George Monbiot – ‘Commentators seek glimpses of light in Trump’s position. There are none’ The world’s biggest solar farm springs up – in China The ever-popular climate quiz And the climate clock, still ticking away I leave you with this: A quick interruption with some breaking news: Scotland has just unveiled some of the world’s most ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions, aiming at a reduction of 66% within 15 years. It’s not quite Norway (which is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2030), but it’s a laudable aim, reports our Scotland editor Severin Carrell, who has all the detail here. Hoesung Lee: ‘Climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action’ Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is up next, talking to Juliette. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? We are continuing to emit greenhouse gases and if unabated this will cause further warming and changes to the climate system. This increases the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Substantial and sustained reduction in emissions are needed to limit climate change.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Individuals can do many things, depending on their local and personal circumstances. One example is improving energy efficiency. Ultimately [though] tackling climate change is a global problem, so individuals should encourage their governments to take action. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I’d like to congratulate Mr Trump on his forthcoming inauguration as President of the United States. We look forward to continuing to work with the new administration, and with American scientists and institutions, on improving our understanding of climate change and how to tackle its impacts and risks, as we have done for nearly 30 years, since the inception of the IPCC.” Mark Campanale: Fossil fuel investors ‘will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on’ Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative thinktank and who conceived the idea that many fossil fuel reserves will be unburnable if the world beats climate change, talks to Damian now: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There is no doubt now that we’re in the middle of a major technological revolution in the transportation and power sectors. Electrification of the transport fleet and the rise of cheap solar isn’t going to be reversed, actually it will accelerate. The real question right now is whether technological leaps and cost reductions in renewables can accelerate adoption rates fast enough. The scale of the challenge is enormous – not helped by new investments in fossil fuels exceeding tens of trillions of dollars over the next few decades. For that reason, we may not be seeing the reductions in fossil fuel power generation capacity that we need. Instead of investors looking at fossil fuel companies as ‘ex growth’ stocks, they are too many that take a ‘business as usual’ growth approach to their investment. Time will tell, but our expectation is that investors [anticipating ‘business as usual’ growth from fossil fuel stocks] will be left holding the baby whilst the world has moved on. The real risk is that the precious years we’ve got to make the difference we need to the future will have been tied up trying to defend the past. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Switch to a clean energy supplier like Good Energy, or maybe a community utility and project developer like Mongoose Energy. May Boeve: ‘The climate movement is more important than ever’ May Boeve, head of climate campaign group 350.org, is next up: What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? I think we’ve entered into a new chapter in the climate fight. Renewables have become cheap and widespread enough to represent a real threat to the fossil fuel industry, so they’re beginning to fight back. If we can make it beyond the political barriers coming up worldwide and elect governments who take climate change seriously, we have all the technology we need to make rapid progress and succeed in keeping global warming as close to 1.5C as possible. But it’s going to be a real fight. The work of the climate movement is more important than ever. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Organize. We can’t solve climate change alone. Get together with people and change your community, your country, and the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history. Ed Davey: ‘To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar’ Former climate secretary and Liberal Democrat MP now talks to Juliette Jowit What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The Paris agreement surpassed my expectations about what’s possible - although it’s still not enough, given where we are. We have had president Obama’s leadership, Xi Jinping’s (China’s) leadership, and president Modi’s (India’s) leadership. Then we had technological break-throughs, particularly solar.” What is your message to President Donald Trump? To fight Isis and make America great again, invest in solar. Where does Isis’ power come from? They are funded by oil and gas, particularly oil.” It would be wrong to think that Donald Trump’s views on climate change reflect those of the American people. While the incoming president is dismissive of the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is real, serious and driven by human activity, the US population is not. A survey in November for the Yale program on Climate Change Communication found that 70% of Americans think climate change is real, and just over half, 55%, believe humans are mostly to blame. The figures are encouraging. But they make clear that the US public, like those in other countries, lags far behind the scientific opinion. The fact is that many people still don’t accept that climate change is driven by human activities, and that it is serious enough to warrant action. In the Guardian’s Science Weekly podcast today, we explore why climate change risks can be hard for us to take on board. Debika Shome at the TCC Group co-authored a report for Columbia University on the psychology of climate change communication. She explains how the perception that global warming is a problem for people who live far away and far in the future, combines with scientific jargon and the inherent uncertainty around climate predictions to make climate change messages an exceptionally tough sell. But here, another field of science can help. Understand human psychology better, and the messages can be made to hit home, she says. During the US presidential re-election campaign in 2012, Matthew McGregor, now at Precision Strategies in New York, ran Barack Obama’s digital rapid response team. Matthew is not an expert on climate change, but he does know how to mobilise people to take action. We asked him how he would make people care more about climate change. Facts, he says, are not enough. Also lending advice is Tima Bansal, professor of sustainability at Ivey Business School in Ontario. The climate change problem cannot be solved without help - and sometimes radical changes in behaviour - from businesses, large and small. But with little incentive to change their ways, what can we as consumers do to force corporations to act in the world’s best interests? As Bansal explains, it could be easier than you think. Ben van Beurden: ‘We don’t have to sacrifice economic growth’ Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell plc, now: It’s good news for all of us that [the Paris climate agreement] came into force. The scenarios that we and others have done clearly show that a future of net-zero emissions is technically feasible near the end of the century. And not only can the world achieve it technically, but it also makes economic sense in a societal way. In other words, we don’t have to sacrifice economic growth. That’s the good part. The remaining challenge is: can it be done commercially? Economically is about the way society can bear it, commercially is about how to make sure the main actors – consumers and companies – can, and will, do the right thing. And if society, through government, doesn’t ensure it makes commercial sense to move to a net-zero emissions energy system, nobody will make the next step. The good thing is that the Paris agreement raised the bar for everyone. Everybody feels the obligation to act. So in that sense I’m actually very optimistic. The nature of the challenge of climate change is that it will require unprecedented levels of co-operation between government, industry and society. What often tends to happen in our industry is that you have either isolated advocacy, or people have a very adversarial approach: I’m for, you’re against. In the end this doesn’t resolve anything. It just creates noise for policymakers. We have to move beyond that and start real collective planning for how we are going to achieve the kind of energy transition the world needs. Craig Bennett: This is ‘decade zero’ Craig Bennett, head of Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, talks to Damian ... What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The climate impacts of global temperature rises of just 1C have already triggered melting ice-caps, unleashed killer storms and droughts, bleached the world’s coral reefs, choked our cities with pollution and displaced people from their homes. The case for urgent action is now universally accepted by governments, scientists, business and ordinary citizens around the world. Whilst trillions of dollars are being invested in the renewable energy sector and building a low carbon economy, this is still too little and too slow. This is ‘decade zero’: The decisions we make now on meeting our energy needs, producing our food and protecting our forests will determine if we can keep temperature rises well below 2C and prevent catastrophic climate change. We’re sitting in the last chance saloon but governments still seem unable to break their addiction to dirty energy – unless people power can make them. What is your message to President Donald Trump? Renewable energy and the low carbon economy is the world’s greatest job creator. Be smart, and lead from the front. Clean energy, owned by American citizens, acting in the interests of American citizens will not only make ‘America Great Again’, it will save lives and protect your nation too. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Be part of the movement to ‘keep fossil fuels in the ground’. It’s as simple as that. Divest your money from banks that fund it, switch energy suppliers to green energy, support communities saying no to fracking, demand our politicians act now before it’s too late. And join an environmental organisation like Friends of the Earth. Professor Dame Julia King: ‘Trump needs to build an economy for 2050, not 1950’ Prof Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change is next up, talking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? To have a good chance of keeping global temperature rise to below 2C the world will need to reverse the rise in greenhouse gas emissions and reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero within the next 50 years or so. This involves switching to clean forms of electricity, transport, cooling and heating, and finding ways to avoid – or mop up – emissions from industry, agriculture, shipping and air travel. We are not currently on track to achieve this, but global momentum is building quickly. What is encouraging is that many companies, cities and citizens are now taking a leading role, alongside pledges and action from governments around the world. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950! What is the best action concerned citizens can take? The Committee on Climate Change recently looked at how to reduce UK emissions over the next 15 years. We found that some of the best things people can do to reduce their household-level carbon footprint are: Save money, by making your home energy efficient, and making choices on food and travel that lower costs and emissions. Take advantage of new technologies – if you drive, switch to a fully electric vehicle and look at a smart home energy system. Make your voice heard, by, for example, continuing to talk to your local politician and others to urge them to act, find out what companies your pension fund invests in and write to the trustees to encourage them to switch to ‘low carbon’ investments. Michael Liebreich: ‘Wind and solar now the cheapest new power sources in much of the world’ Now it’s Michael Liebreich, founder of analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance and who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy, speaking to Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? The past decade gives us enormous cause for optimism. Relentless growth in global CO2 emissions has been brought to a halt much earlier than anyone thought possible. Wind and solar power have become the cheapest new power sources in much of the world; natural gas is outcompeting carbon-intensive coal; LEDs and other energy efficiency solutions are being installed at scale; and electric vehicles are starting to fly out of showrooms. But it’s not enough to stabilise emissions: to stay within a 2C carbon budget we have to see emissions cut dramatically and quickly, which remains a staggering challenge. The Paris agreement set out ambitious long-term aspirations, but its near-term commitments don’t add up to much. In particular, if Asian countries build all the coal-fired power stations currently in their plans, then kiss goodbye to the 2C warming target. What is your message to President Donald Trump? If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America Great Again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? Focus on a few big things. If you are renovating, insist on lots of insulation, good windows, a good boiler and efficient appliances. You can cut your fuel bills by 75% – I know because I’ve done it. If you live in a city, get rid of your car: join a car club, walk or cycle more, use cabs and public transport. Again, I know because I haven’t owned a car in London for 22 years. And don’t fly short-haul, use trains – you’ll get there quicker too. John Schellnhuber: ‘We are now at a watershed in history’ Prof John Schellnhuber, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, and who has advised Angela Merkel, the Pope and the EU, now speaks to Damian Carrington. We are now at a watershed in history I think, because the traditional industrialised countries – US, UK, parts of Europe, Australia – are now more or less giving up being pioneers for climate action and it is emerging economies [like China and India] that are doing the bold steps. The world is upside down really. The old developed world has more or less lost faith in saving the planet and it is the new economies who seem to take the lead. This is the hope we have. Politicians can’t do it on their own. The political process is so slow and dysfunctional almost everywhere. There are two factors that can accelerate our transition to sustainability. One is clearly technological progress, which is often much faster than anybody expects. The other is civil society, you have to put pressure on your politicians. You have to raise the moral bar much higher. You have ask them ‘do we want to save this planet for our descendents or not? On the actions concerned individuals can take, Schellnhuber said three things stick out: Try to avoid using airplanes. Whenever you do a carbon balance sheet, you see flying is just the worst thing you can do regarding your carbon footprint and often it is more convenient to take a train these days. Second is to reduce your meat consumption, if you eat any, and that is also good for your health. The third one is follow the money: the fossil fuel divestment movement. Tell your bank manager you would like your money be invested into renewables instead of coal, oil and gas industry. At least become a pain in the neck. What companies fear like hell is loss of reputation, as that can break even the big companies’ necks. Nicholas Stern: ‘Destruction of the environment would reverse economic growth’ Leading climate change economist Lord Nicholas Stern, at the London School of Economics, has also spoken to Damian Carrington for this blog. Stern said global action on climate change has made substantial progress, with the Paris agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals creating a global agenda for the first time since the end of the second world war. It was agreed by everybody and applies to everybody. That is extremely important and quite extraordinary when you think how difficult it is to put together a global agenda with 196 countries. But he said it was openly acknowledged that the Paris deal leaves a big gap between the current plans and what is needed to avoid 2C of global warming - the danger limit agreed by the world’s nations. The next very big question is how do we ramp up those ambitions. China, the biggest emitter, is ahead of the game. It said it would peak [its carbon emissions] by 2030, but my guess is it will peak not very long after 2020. That is the key example. I have been working in China for 30 years and the change over the last six to seven is quite remarkable. India is starting to get much more committed too. So if you look at the two countries with the biggest populations, you do see changes. But the US and Europe will matter greatly to this. It is very important Europe raises its game. Stern said Donald Trump needs to back the green economy to take advantage of the growing global demand for clean energy, which is being driven by the worldwide commitment to tackling global warming. If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth. Stern said concerned individuals should put pressure on governments and businesses: Demand explicitly and directly strong action from the politicians, particularly in cities where we know action can be extremely rapid. Do your shopping at firms that are responsible. It does need political, business and civil society push. The reason is that the urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood. We will double the world economy in the next 20 years or so. If we build this new world economy anything like the old one, then we are not going to get down to the [emissions] we have to be. There has to be radical change. Professor James Hansen Director of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and ‘father of climate change awareness’ spoke to the Guardian after winning the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? “The global temperature has increased since 1970 at about 0.18C per decade, and it’s going to continue at approximately that rate, because the climate change is driven by environmental imbalance: there’s more energy going in from the sun than out into space, because of the climate change gases. “The climate impacts are extremely detrimental, and the worst one is seal level rise, because of the ice sheets going unstable, [and] the economic and humanitarian cost of that is devastating.” What is the best action concerned citizens can take? “The single most important thing [individuals] can do is to join Citizens Climate lobby: they [and] other organisations advocate a simple rising carbon fee. People that join are asked to write letters to the editor, op eds [comments in newspapers], write to representatives, legislators, and they do it in a respectful way. What is your message to President Donald Trump? “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” Photographs of the melting Greenland ice sheet by Timo Lieber are a beautiful but chilling reminder of the impact of climate change. All photographs use three colours. Each represents a symbolic value: pristine white is the ice sheet, blue is water and black is dirt. These colours form the chromatic point of view and are the clue to reading them. Beyond this simplicity, the pictures are scientific documents that reveal and link the two global phenomenons: global warming and atmospheric pollution. “The images are deliberately abstract.” says Timo Lieber in an interview by Tim Walker. “I didn’t want them to be documentary photographs. You have to get close to find the small, hidden details that help you to understand what you’re seeing. They’re beautiful, but what you’re looking at is climate change at its worst. My favourite is the one that looks like an eye. It’s a half-circle of concentric blues at the top of the image – it’s almost as if global warming is looking right back at you.” UN climate chief: ‘There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need’ Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change - the UN’s climate chief – today gives her views on climate change to our head of environment Damian Carrington. What is your current assessment of how the world is dealing with climate change? There are very positive actions and signals from all areas of society post-Paris [climate agreement] including from governments and cities to business, investors and citizens. But the reality is also that greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere continue to rise and thus national and international ambition needs to rise even more. The world needs to peak global emissions urgently and trigger a steady but significant de-carbonisation of the global economy so that year on year and decade on decade the total achievement is in line with the science. We are on the way towards a better, climate-secure world, but it will be a long journey and only a sense of urgency will get us to the ‘well below 2C target’. What is your message to President Donald Trump? I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world. What is the best action concerned citizens can take? There is a lot all of us can do to bend the curve towards the world we want and need. Get informed and get involved. Be a conscious-consumer for example: there is wealth of information on the environmental footprint of goods and services. Think about how you travel, and try to choose a lower emissions form of transport while offsetting those emissions you cannot avoid right now. 2017 is the UN’s International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development – take time to do so research on the sustainability of your holiday and leisure activities. If you are lucky enough to have a pension or investments, find out how your money is being used – is it supporting environmentally-sustainable companies or not. Get more involved in your community and city — actively argue and support public transport policies; renewable energy; energy efficient initiatives and ones to back forests; wetlands and other nature-based ‘infrastructure’. Thanks Damian. I hope that hour answered lots of your questions. If not, keep them coming. New York will take over from us within the next hour, and our US environment correspondent Oliver Milman will be at the helm. Here’s another fact for you: Coming up: what are the best books and films about climate change? What animals are most at risk from climate change right now? Plus: a word with the experts, unfashionable as they may be in some quarters these days. We’ve spoken to a plethora of leading figures climate change debate and found a surprising amount of consensus about what needs to happen next to our climate. Last question I’m afraid, but it’s a good one, from ‏@takvera. Low. Although you are right that those ice caps are very vulnerable to global warming, it takes a long time to melt such big chunks of ice. But in coming centuries, the risk is very real. The last time the Earth had CO2 levels as high as this, sea level was many metres above what it is today. That would wipe out many of the world’s biggest cities. ‏@OisinMoriarty asks about electric car takeup. A long way is the truth, but the takeup is accelerating very fast. There were about 2m electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2016. That’s just 1% of the market in Europe and China. But as cheaper models with longer ranges arrive and cities crack down on air pollution, more and more will take to the roads. On Twitter, ‏@FourTwoThreeOne asks: Right here, right now is the answer. Scorching heatwaves are already five times more likely thanks to global warming and it’s not going to get better until carbon emissions start to fall. You can read more here. MercuryBen asks a political question. Why is it that climate change scepticism is so popular with those on the right-wing? I’d suggest two reasons. First is that tackling global warming requires communal action, which for those libertarians far to the right looks just like communism. Communism is evil, therefore climate change can’t exist. The second reason is that the fossil fuel lobby gives far more money to rightwing politicians, as they are seen to be more “pro-business” than those on the left. But as the Tory politician John Gummer, now Lord Deben, argues today: “Conservatives cannot properly be climate deniers. At the heart of their political stance is a desire to hand on something better to the future than they have received from the past.” ID5865653 asks an important question about whether aviation can be made greener. Does anyone know what, if any, progress is being made on making flights more carbon neutral? I know there was a successful round-the-world solar flight in 2016, but that doesn’t seem likely to bear fruit commercially any time time soon. Are the fuel requirements just too large for electric planes etc to be practical? Flying does have a heavy carbon footprint – about 1 tonne for every economy passenger from London to New York and back. But I don’t think electric planes – like Solar Impulse – will ever carry many passengers. Batteries are just too heavy and solar panels need too much area. More likely is the adoption of a sustainable biofuel for jets, perhaps from algae, jatropha or even tobacco. But progress has been slow. For freight at least, air ships are a possible future alternative. For now, using a good carbon offset scheme is the only solution. The livestock industry causes about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and CordTrousers asks: Any suggestions other than vegetarianism? Meat does have a heavy carbon (and methane) footprint, but not all meat is equal. Beef has by far the biggest footprint, so cutting out that alone makes a big difference. Reducing meat consumption, rather than going vegetarian, is also an option backed by many, dubbed climatarian or reducatarian. As it happens, lots of people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy, so cutting back would help lengthen many lives. Also, lots of new companies are starting to produce vegetable-based substitutes for meat and dairy products, aiming to make them as tasty, healthy and affordable as the originals. PeppermintSeal wants to know what the impact of ocean acidification might be. Much of the world’s CO2 emissions end up being absorbed by the oceans, which become more acidic as a result. Regarding the increased acidity in the oceans, what follows from this? More coastal erosion and threat to sea life I’m guessing, but are there other things happening? Does acidity affect salt levels? Ocean acidification is real but research is still ongoing. This is from a UK research programme: “Already ocean pH has decreased by about 30% and if we continue emitting CO2 at the same rate by 2100 ocean acidity will increase by about 150%, a rate that has not been experienced for at least 400,000 years. Such a monumental alteration in basic ocean chemistry is likely to have wide implications for ocean life, especially for those organisms that require calcium carbonate to build shells or skeletons.” I think acidification is unlikely to affect salinity or coastal erosion. But rising sea levels and fiercer storms will affect coastlines. Lots of commenters, for example greensocialist147, are arguing that overpopulation is the fundamental problem. The world’s population is set to rise to 9 or 10 billion by 2050, which definitely makes beating climate change tougher. But the critical thing is the size of their carbon footprints. If they all cause the same emissions as today’s Americans or Australians, we are doomed to catastrophic climate change. But if, as is difficult but possible, emissions from energy, transport and buildings are reduced to very low levels, then a large global population can live sustainably on the planet. In terms of curbing population growth, poverty reduction, education for girls and availability of contraception for those who want it are vital. Crucial question next from yourcomment. Is it compulsory for every article on global warming to feature a photo of a polar bear? Why? Well, no. But they are beautiful animals and the Arctic is warming far faster than the rest of the planet. But the research here suggests, among many things, that images of real people are effective ways to communicate the significance of climate change, too. Reader rokealy wants to know how climate change will affect the UK and Europe. This is such an important matter and delighted that you are covering this in such an excellent way. Really educational yet at the same time quite unsettling. With the rise in temperatures, and various reports coming to conclusions that Europe will get warmer or colder, can you give a clearer picture of what we (Ireland, UK, Europe) can expect to see in our climate in the near future? The short answer is: more extremes. With more heat in the atmosphere, there’s more energy to drive more extreme events, such as storms. In the UK, the main consequences are more severe flooding and more deadly heatwaves, which the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, say are high risks already. Summers are likely to get drier and hotter overall and winters warmer and wetter. But there will also be extreme cold snaps, probably driven by the fast-melting ice in the Arctic. Next up is a question from Clare Rudkin, on whether global warming can be blamed for specific events. I would like to know the percent of increase in likelihood of events that seem to be linked to climate change. Weather has a lot of natural variability, but climate changes increases the chances of many types of extreme weather – loading the dice, if you like. Scientists are getting better and faster at calculating how much the probability of heatwaves etc occurring are increased by global warming. In some cases, it’s a lot. Warm sea temperatures linked to severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef were made at least 175 times more likely, the extreme Russian heatwave of 2010 was made three times more likely, major floods in Paris in 2016 were made almost twice as likely. Hi! I’m Damian Carrington, head of environment at the Guardian, and I’ll be tackling your climate questions for the next 45 minutes or so. Please post anything you’d like to ask in the comments below or tweet me @dpcarrington. Here’s the first one, from Sandie Elsom. Congratulations on deciding to focus on this most important of all issues. I’d like to see clear explanations of what the science is saying and just how serious the outcomes will be. I have difficulty convincing family members that climate change is a clear and present danger. These webpages by Nasa are very good: clear and striking. You could also take a look at the assessment of the world’s scientists produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It concludes that global warming is set to inflict “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly. The assessment involved thousands of scientists – probably the biggest scientific review in human history – and was approved by 196 nations, making it as definitive as it gets. Journalism often tends to focus on the problems, and as such can often give a glum view of the world. But during this hour we’ve heard from: The Egyptian hydroponics farmer trying to beat the drought the team at the Thames Barrier in London, the kind of tech that might be needed elsewhere in the world the British Antarctic Survey, keeping tabs on climate change at the bottom of the earth some of the innovators offering 21st-century ideas to fix a 21st-century problem Soon we’re going to hand over to Damian Carrington, our head of environment, to answer your questions. But before we go, can I make a personal plea for you to consider joining us as a member? Journalism is a costly business, as I’m sure you can appreciate from the work that has gone into this product. But we do it because we believe things like this can make a difference, can help build the movement to roll back climate change. If everyone reading this blog gave just a small amount, we would be on a far firmer footing to keep producing work like this. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. Many thanks everyone. Here’s the hourly Twitter card: When it comes to green tech, the electricity sector has seen the biggest focus so far, with the cost of solar, wind, LED lighting and batteries plummeting in the last decade. The cost of conventional nuclear power has not, but so-called “small modular reactors” (SMR) are now attracting a lot of attention: smaller, cheaper and mass produced is the promise. An SMR design was recently submitted to regulators in the US, but Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, is not holding his breath. “I do laugh when people talk about SMRs being five years around the corner. The licensing conditions for nuclear – quite correctly – imply a very slow development process because you can’t mess around with it.” The great hope for nuclear for decades has been nuclear fusion, which carries the prospect of cleaner and limitless energy. However, even those building the biggest fusion experiment in the world – ITER in France – acknowledge that commercial nuclear fusion will not come before 2050, by which time global emissions will already have to be near zero. Much faster to deliver will be smart grids, which apply data and communication software to make far more efficient use of existing electricity, creating in effect “virtual power stations”. These, along with storage of intermittent renewable energy, are the most important technologies, say experts, allowing countries to move to 100% renewable energy on the grid. Big batteries are already replacing power plants in California. A breakthrough in battery chemistry to deliver cheaper, more powerful devices is being sought around the world but they are not the only way to store energy – a plant in the UK is already using air compressed into a liquid. New renewable technologies are also being investigated. Researchers are seeking breakthroughs in solar energy, a truly global energy source, aiming to make panels that capture even more of the sun by, for example, using perovskite crystals instead of silicon. I’ve been looking at all kinds of technology that promises to help us battle climate change in the decades to come. Of course, renewables have been a quiet success story over the past 20 years – but this is only half the picture. From solar air ships to lab-grown meat, algae jet fuel to nuclear fusion, technology innovations around the world hold the hope of slashing carbon emissions and giving a big boost to the battle against global warming. Mission Innovation, a collaboration involving 50 of the world’s biggest nations, is set to invest $30bn a year by 2020 on clean technology, and the UK’s special representative for climate change, Sir David King, played a leading role in its creation. One of his favourites is a huge new airship being developed by a British company, VariaLift, to provide low-carbon freight transport. The plan is to cover the airships with photovoltaics, then rise them to 50,000 feet where there is very little air resistance. Solar energy can then power the electrical engines and the airship could reach speeds of 340km/h. Also attracting attention is a German idea to store energy in regions without mountains, where pumped-water storage cannot be used. Heindl Energy’s solution is to raise a giant column of rock using the pumped water, which is then allowed to fall again when the energy is needed. The allure of new technology is strong, not only to speed up cuts in emissions, but also because of the colossal market it represents, offering good jobs and economic growth. The International Energy Agency estimates that $44tn will be invested in energy by 2040, with an ever bigger slice going to clean technologies. Of course, science is a vital part of our understanding of climate change, and down at the bottom of the earth, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are conducting a range of experiments and observations to keep tabs on any changes in conditions. The BAS collaborated with us to get exclusive video back from the Antarctic, and my colleague Irene Baqué put together this short package to show what’s going on. While flood defences are often criticised and the government is regularly accused of failing to account sufficiently for how much climate change is making it worse, the UK’s Thames barrier has been a real, unsung success story. Built in eight years, its six gates have never failed to protect London. In the early hours of last Saturday morning, Steve East made a judgment call to protect Londoners from the Thames. Faced with tidal and weather forecasts and other data, the engineering manager of the Thames Barrier decided to raise it for the second occasion in 2017 and the 178th time since it was finished in 1982. The result was a 3.3 metre differential – the height of the water level on the downstream side, which leads out to the North Sea, above the upstream side of central and west London, which the huge structure protects. “It’s an art, not a science because we are making decisions on forecasts,” he tells me, as we overlook the barrier where the rotating gates are raised in times of need. East started working as an administrator at the barrier 31 years ago. Over that he time, he’s not seen a linear line showing the barrier being closed more frequently, but a more jagged line with spikes in individual years. For example, in one recent year the barrier was closed on 50 occasions in just a three month period. Before that it had gone about two years without a closure. “It’s an easy decision to close it. The hard decision is not to close it,” he says. While closure protects Londoners and property from flooding, it also stops river traffic, wildlife such as seals, and puts a “strain on the asset”, as East puts it, wearing the barrier out. The barrier should last until about 2070. Climate change means a 20-90cm sea level rise in the Thames by 2100, according to the Met Office and Defra, and East is clear: “There’s an acknowledgment that sea level rise will require a new barrier.” Planning is just beginning on what location and size that barrier might take, but the project is anticipated to cost £10bn. Some of that money will go on raising and strengthening the tidal walls downstream of the barrier, and making space for water downstream to overflow into during tidal surges, such as car parks and playgrounds. East thinks that when the barrier starts having 50 closures a year regularly – at the moment the average is four annually – that’s when a new barrier will be needed. But for now – even with the two closures in less than a month this year – “we’re a long way from that”. Across the Middle East and north Africa, global warming means record temperatures, which in the summer can make life unbearable from Tehran to Tripoli. The knock-on impact on farming in the region has been severe – indeed some people have even blamed the Arab spring partly on the way climate change has depleted agriculture. But some enterprising farmers are finding ways to beat the drought, like this Egyptian extolling the virtues of hydroponic farming – that uses more than 95% less water by not planting in soil. A final three tips on positive individual action here from Chris Goodall: • For a decade, investors ignored the movement that advocated the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. Large fuel companies and electricity generation businesses were able to raise the many billions of new finance they needed. Now, by contrast, money managers are increasingly wary of backing the investment plans of oil companies and switching to renewable projects. And universities and activist investors around the world are selling their holdings in fossil fuels, making it more difficult for these companies to raise new money. Vocal support for those backing out of oil, gas and coal helps keep up the pressure. • Politicians tend to do what their electorates want. The last major UK government survey showed that 82% of people supported the use of solar power, with only 4% opposed. A similar survey in the US showed an even larger percentage in favour. The levels of support for onshore wind aren’t much lower, either in the US or the UK. We need to actively communicate these high levels of approval to our representatives and point out that fossil fuel use is far less politically popular. • Buy gas and electricity from retailers who sell renewable power. This helps grow their businesses and improves their ability to provide cost-competitive fuels to us. Renewable natural gas is just coming on to the market in reasonable quantities in many countries and fossil-free electricity is widely available. Think about switching to a supplier that is working to provide 100% clean energy. Chris’s 15 things you can do to help stop manmade climate change is published in full here. Have we really been going five hours? We’re just getting warmed up. No pun intended. If you’re waking up in America, stay tuned: our New York office will be taking over this running article in a couple of hours, with the focus switching to the inauguration tomorrow. In the past hour, we’ve really only had time to skim the surface of some of the good things going on in this time zone: the Afghan hero trying to reforest an entire province the Israelis who turn salt water into drinkable stuff – and export the technology around the world the Swedes building a carbon sink in Stockholm Please do post your questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, to answer, or you can email him on damian.carrington@theguardian.com. He’ll be with us at 1pm GMT. And here’s another fact for you: Right then. We’ve not nearly finished with good news so we’re going to carry on past the hour with more inspiring people and technology, starting with the Egyptian farmer beating the drought with smart water-saving kit. This month sees the launch in Stockholm of the world’s first urban carbon sink. The project will trap carbon from garden waste and store it in the ground, thereby compensating for the emissions of around 700 cars. The idea is based on turning wood and other organic waste into “biochar”, produced like charcoal by heating it in the absence of oxygen. The first firings will make use of thousands of discarded Christmas trees. In the shadow of a large conventional power station in the southern suburbs, the new carbon sink will produce 300 tonnes of biochar a year, which will then be used to fertilise the city’s parks and green spaces. In turn, heat generated during the process will be used to heat local apartments. Simon Rea, of of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which is sponsoring the project, told me: This is the world’s first urban carbon sink. We want other cities to be inspired by Stockholm and start their own biochar production. Combatting “climate apathy” in this way is seen as an important aspect of the project, which wants to involve Stockholmers and make them feel that they themselves have a role to play in influencing the climate. The project organisers say that three more cities and a US federal state have already shown an interest: Melbourne in Australia, Mysore in India, Parma in Italy, and the state of California. Mattias Gustafsson of Stockholm Water, told me: It is just the beginning. This natural carbon sink will not save the world but we must begin to pay off our carbon debts. Israel has long experience of dealing with some of the pressing demands of climate change. Inside the high pressure hall at the world’s largest water desalination plant on the Israeli coast near Rishon Lezion, a forest of pressure vessels is humming with the sound of sea water being made drinkable at the equivalent of 65 atmospheres. The plant, completed just three years ago, is at the cutting edge of a desalination technology being exported around the world from China to India, to California and Australia, promising new sources of water in a warming world. The success of the Sorek plant and others like it in Israel – built by Israel Desalination Engineering [IDE] – is a testament to recent leaps made in desalination technology. One hundred years ago the British in Mandatory Palestine predicted that water would be an issue for a growing population, a challenge that has obsessed Israeli politicians over the decades. Today, Israel is a net exporter of water and its desalination plants provide almost 65% of the country’s potable and industrial water. Advances in reverse osmosis water purification technology have made it possible to build plants large and small, and increasingly environmentally friendly, allowing the production of drinkable water wherever there is access to the sea. The process is fast and relatively cheap. In the space of the Guardian’s visit to the plant, sea water extracted from the Mediterranean was cleaned once by being passed through large filtration tanks, cleaned a second time, then filtered in the high pressure hall before having traces of boron removed in a cascade and then treated to soften the water and make it drinkable. Udi Tirosh, of IDE, told me: There has long been an interest here in water recovery. Water shortages are a world issue. California has suffered six years of successive droughts. We are working on a new plant north of San Diego as well as a facility in Tienjiang south of Beijing in China which also has water shortage issues – a thermal extraction plant in this case. In India we are working on a plant for an industrial concern. Terry Macalister, formerly the Guardian’s energy editor and now on the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series steering committee, has just sent this blog post in to us: Terry writes: Global carbon emissions could be cut by one third within 12 months if affluent westerners changed their way of life, according at least to one leading climate change scientist. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the UK’s Manchester University, says a major reduction in personal air travel is a key starting point. More than half of the Co2 pollution which causes global warming comes from the 10% best-off people on the planet, he argues. “Let’s be clear about this. If the top 10 high emitters – people like you and me and others – if we reduce our carbon footprint just to the level of the average European it would be a one-third cut in global emissions. “I genuinely think we could achieve it in one year but we would have to think that climate change is a very serious issue and that has big political implications.” Anderson, who already avoids flying where he can, made his comments in the run up to a talk he will give on 9 March at Cambridge University. This is part of a new town and gown initiative, the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series, designed to rekindle more debate on global warming. Anderson is convinced that wealthy westerners must act decisively and radically to change their lifestyles. “Those of us who are high emitters … need to rapidly curtail how often we fly. We should not be flying on any occasion business class or first class because that has far higher emissions. We need to find alternatives to flying. “But in addition, we need to make sure that we are not living in larger houses and have many houses, and drive larger cars. “Our high incomes allow us to have status in society and typically have larger carbon footprints. It is a real challenge for us in that position because we have to significantly change in the short-term our lives and find other ways of seeing value for hard work.” Anderson plans to use his talk to explain what kind of personal, societal and corporate changes need to be made in Britain to meet the UK government’s commitment under the Paris climate change agreement. Afghanistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change – but some people are trying to make a difference. An estimated 80% of Afghanistan’s natural resources have been destroyed over four decades of conflict, Ahmad Seyer, director of the Rural Green Environmental Organisation (RGEO) and one of the few Afghan charities working to mitigate the effects of climate change, has told me. Seyer, a civil engineer by training, worked to protect the environment since the mid-1990s, during the Taliban regime, when he worked with international agencies. But it was not until three years ago that he really became aware of the problems associated with climate change. Since then, climate change has been an integral part of the environment awareness training his organisation provides to mosques and schools. In most villages where I go, they actually understand. Climate change is visible to them now. There is not enough snow, and not enough rain. RGEO works across 90 villages in Badakhshan in Afghanistan’s remote northeast to protect biodiversity. Only three percent of Afghanistan’s surface is covered by forests. Loggers and people in need of wood to burn during winter threaten what is left. RGEO has reforested 200,000 trees to help absorb greenhouse gases and provide protection for communities during flash floods, which hit Badakhshan almost every year. Last year, following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake, a flood destroyed over 800 homes in the province. However, while a more sustainable environment would help boost livelihoods in the long term, for many families, economic concerns, compounded by war and unemployment, are more immediate. Farmers have had to sell livestock to survive. Many migrate to Iran to work as day labourers, and some choose to join the insurgency, Seyer said. “Compared to previous years, people have become so poor,” he said. In 2015, RGEO received the UN’s Equator Prize, which has helped boost funding for his organisation. It now runs on about $100,000 over the next couple of years, about half of which is provided by the United Nations Development Program. Faced with the task of convincing fellow Afghans, living in dire conditions, to care about the environment, Seyer said he was dismayed to see the incoming American president scoff at climate change. “This is not a joke. Please fight against climate change,” he said, addressing Donald Trump. “NGOs can’t do this alone. Hundreds of people can’t do it; thousands of people can’t do it. Everybody needs to come together.” Back to more positive actions that individuals can take. For obvious reasons most of these tips (again from Chris Goodall) focus on what wealthier citizens (which includes most westerners) can do. Here are three: • The CO2 impact of goods and services is often strikingly different from what you’d expect. Mike Berners-Lee’s book How Bad Are Bananas? takes an entertaining and well-informed look at what really matters. Bananas, for example, are fine because they are shipped by sea. But organic asparagus flown in from Peru is much more of a problem. • Invest in your own sources of renewable energy. Putting solar panels on the roof still usually makes financial sense, even after most countries have ceased to subsidise installation. Or buy shares in new cooperatively owned wind, solar or hydroelectric plants that are looking for finance. The financial returns won’t be huge – perhaps 5% a year in the UK, for example – but the income is far better than leaving your money in a bank. • Buy from companies that support the switch to a low-carbon future. An increasing number of businesses are committed to 100% renewable energy. Unilever, the global consumer goods business, says its operations will be better than carbon-neutral by 2030. Those of us concerned about climate change should buy from businesses acting most aggressively to reduce their climate impact. Over the next hour we’re going to try to focus on the positive. We’ll look more at what we can all do as individuals, and at inspirational work both locally and internationally to combat manmade climate change. It’s really easy to feel despairing and overwhelmed about climate change. Personally I found this piece by Chris Goodall today to be both inspiring and cheering. He writes about how he used to believe that only massive government subsidies would make clean energy a success, which basically meant it would be a failure. Now he admits he was “completely wrong” about that, and argues that the end of the fossil-fuel era is already in sight: In fact, optimism about successfully tackling climate change has never been more justified, because 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. The full article is here. So Europe might not be on the frontline of climate change but it’s already feeling the depradations of flooding, drought, and rising sea levels. Over the past hour we’ve reported on: •In Italy, questions as to whether climate change might transform wine making. •Insurers reporting a sharp increase in weather-related payouts. •And we are still trying to draw climate change. Finally, another fact for you: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian’s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure.

In Spain, Sam Jones reports that some forecasters believe that southern Spain will be reduced to desert by 2100 if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked. Researchers looked at the consequences for vegetation in the Mediterranean basin under a variety of possible temperature rises. In the worst case scenario – which would see global temperatures rising by nearly 5C by the end of the century – deserts would expand northwards across southern Spain and Sicily, and deciduous forests would be replaced by Mediterranean vegetation. Roughly a third of Spain would find itself as arid by then as the Tabernas desert in Almería is today. As one ecologist has pointed out, a rise of nearly 5C would be “like bringing Casablanca to Madrid”. This warming has implications for the Alps too. The Guardian’s Stephanie Kirchgaessner, says that in the Italian resort of Obereggen, sometimes it has not been cold enough to give the town much time to crank up its snow production. Resident Thomas Ondertoller told her: Last year we had one week to make the snow. We use a lot of water, and a lot of technical expertise, to make as much snow as possible, because usually after that there is a warm period. For the passionate skier, the product is perfect. For the romantic skier, something is missing,” he says. Further north, it is the sea, not the snow that is the problem, Jennifer Rankin reports from Belgium. Authorities in Flanders, guardians of Belgium’s 73km strip of coastline, are spending €8m (£6.9m) to investigate whether they can build an island to keep the rising tide at bay. The newest bit of Belgium would be off the coast of Knokke, the genteel resort best known for its picturesque dunes and posh golf course. Under an early plan, the island would be 40 hectares big, but could be made 10 times larger over time. Across the border, the Dutch have built the world’s biggest storm barrier, near Rotterdam. The Maeslant barrier – two enormous steel gates almost as long as the Eiffel tower – is designed to protect the port city and the rest of southern Holland from a once in a 10,000-year storm. Peter Persoon, an engineer-turned-tour guide, said: What we tell the people here in the Netherlands is, if the country is flooded the damage will be at least €700bn. If you instead spend every year one billion euros, you spread the bill over 700 years. That is, I think, the Dutch way.” For years, the biggest problem facing vineyard owners in Tuscany’s Chianti region has been the prevalence of scavaging wild boars in the area, a relatively modern phenomenon in the ancient winemaking region. But the threat of climate change could soon eclipse the havoc that has been wrought by the swine, according to a local climatologist who said changes in temperature are already having an effect on wine production in Italy. Giampiero Maracchi, a professor at the University of Florence and expert in sustainability and agriculture, says rising temperatures have already increased the amount of sugar in wines from the north to the south of Italy, though the change might not yet be noticeable. “For the time being, there has been no real negative effect on quality. For the future, it is yet to be seen,” he said. There has been another change related to climate that is sure to have a bigger impact: harvests in Chianti are now happening earlier than in the past. The harvest period used to be around 1 October, he said, but now it is happening between 1-15 September, often because of heatwaves. These are occurring with greater frequency and intensity in the summer months, leading to a faster maturation of the grapes. It means that in the future, in a decade to three decades from now, grapes in the Chianti region may require irrigation, which is not required now. “If we look to the models, with the projected increases in temperature, there will be a water shortage and probably in the future – 10 or 20 or 30 years – we should require some irrigation for grapes. It means we should have some reservoirs of water,” he said. Maracchi said the issue is not necessarily at the top of farmers’ minds, though it should be. “You know, up until the time comes that they can see some effect from the economic point of view, they are not concerned,” he said. “They should be, in my opinion, because climate change is a general problem and we [will] have a lot of trouble.” It is not just an Italian phenomenon. In its 2016 global wine output estimate, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine last year said it expected global wine production to drop by about 5% due to “climatic events”, causing steep drops in production in Chile and Argentina. While the group did not point a finger of blame at climate change specifically, it suggested that global warming, coupled with natural climate variability, were causing a profound change in the wine business, and had made 2016 one of the worst wine production periods in the past two decades. The other issue that looms for Europe is that of climate refugees. War and persecution have forced more people to flee their homes than at any time since records began. But droughts, flooding and storms are also having a catastrophic effect. Almost 60 million people around the world fled their homes in 2014 due to conflict, according to the UN agency for refugees. In the same year, 19.3 million were forced to move because of natural disasters, a study by the Norwegian Refugee Council concluded. Only a small number came to Europe. The majority fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa go to neighbouring countries or regions; most victims of extreme weather live in Asia. Nevertheless, European Union policymakers, struggling to cope with large numbers of recently-arrived migrants, are aware that climate refugees could be on their doorstep. This week the EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, told the Guardian: Europe is also surrounded by regions that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and we can definitely not afford to ignore the links between climate change and migration. He is careful about drawing links between climate change and migration, saying that climate change can multiply instability, conflict and state fragility, prompting people to leave their homes. Statistics are difficult to pin down, partly because of the role environmental degradation plays in fuelling conflict. Scientists have said a devastating drought in Syria between 2006-2010 – and the weak response of Bashar al-Assad’s government – was a contributory factor to the ongoing conflict. British economist, Nicholas Stern, has estimated that up to 200 million people could be displaced by climate change by 2050. But not all will end up in safer places. People leaving desertified villages can move to towns lying on a flood-plain. Some will not afford to be able to move: natural disasters that impoverish communities make it harder for people to start again somewhere else. This means climate change is also likely to put more pressure on the EU’s humanitarian aid budget, worth €1.27bn (£1.1bn) in 2014. Stylianides says the EU is spending more on reducing the risk of disasters. But only 13% of EU aid is spent on prevention, while the demand for urgent humanitarian help is growing. The Guardian has published a leader article on Trump and climate change today. It makes the point that while Trump may be able to wreak a lot of damage on the climate front, it’s not all going to be up to him: There’s no doubt the world will lose out if America decides to relinquish global leadership on battling climate change. But Mr Trump’s fossil fuel plans are likely to flounder without higher hydrocarbon prices. No one will frack for gas unless profits can be made. Coal mines won’t reopen while shale gas is cheap. Instead, self-interest will undergird the fight against global warming. China will decarbonise to ensure its citizens don’t choke to death in its cities. The costs of clean energy are tumbling too, keeping nations on the path towards decarbonisation. The price of electric vehicles is dropping; offshore wind power has become dramatically cheaper. For the first time, the costs of wind and solar power have dropped to match those of fossil fuels. Last year was the first in which renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s biggest source of power-generating capacity. Countries such as India have ambitious plans for renewable energy. You can read the full leader here. More on Europe in a minute, including Belgian flood defences, poor snow at ski resorts (boo hoo) and the grave threat to Chianti ... But first something completely different. We’re going over to Facebook live to watch people draw climate change. You may laugh. This might not work. You may get a better view of what’s going on by going here. If global warming has a canary in the mine, perhaps it’s the insurance industry. After all, they are the people who have to pay out when extreme weather events hit. And in Europe, they’ve been paying out more and more in recent years, as an extraordinary succession of flooding and storms sweep the continent. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, have shown me data indicating that the number of devastating floods requiring big payouts has more than doubled since 1980. The firm’s latest data shows there were 30 flood events requiring insurance payouts in Europe last year – up from just 12 in 1980. Globally, 2016 saw 384 flood disasters, compared with 58 in 1980, although the greater proportional increase probably reflects poorer flood protections and lower building standards in the developing world. Munich Re’s Ernst Rauch told me: In Europe, we’ve seen a steep increase in flood events related to severe convective [thunder] storms. The frequency of flash floods has increased much more than river floods since 1980. Here’s the full article. Now then, something a bit different. Yesterday, the world’s leading temperature authorities announced that yes, 2016 was the hottest year on record, and that the world was on average 1.1C warmer than in pre-industrial times. The idea of rising temperatures can be hard to visualise. So why not sit back and listen to it instead: So the UK is by no means immune to climate change, and in the next hour, we’ll discover that that goes for Europe too. Do keep your comments coming – there’s a really vibrant debate going on below the line. If you would prefer a Spanish version, have a look at what our partners Univision are doing here. And if you fancy contributing something more artistic or visual, then Tumblr is the place to go. Finally, our fact of the hour, on the hour, every hour. Well, five minutes late – sorry about that. The UK’s attempts to cut its CO2 emissions are in real danger of being undermined unless ministers tackle the continuing erosion of peatlands, which store several billion tonnes of carbon, Scottish environment campaigners have warned. Recent studies estimate that damaged peatlands – most frequently found in upland areas, already release about 16m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year through erosion, burning for grouse shooting and overgrazing. Scientists expect that to worsen dramatically as rising temperatures dry out peatland in rain-starved areas, and extreme weather events increase, without concerted effort to protect and conserve them. That in turn will increase flash flooding of lowland towns and villages. Scientists estimate that Scottish peatlands, which cover about a quarter of Scotland’s landmass, lock up about 1.7 gigatonnes of CO2. Jonny Hughes, chief executive of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and chair of the UK’s International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) peatlands project said: Peatlands are just not in good enough health to withstand the effects of climate change in the coming decades. Watching peatland landscapes washed away due to climate change sounds like a dystopian nightmare. Yet climate modelling predicts it to be a very real threat, leading to the loss of millions of tonnes of carbon and the destruction of an entire living ecosystem.” Here are three more tips on individual action you can take to help, courtesy of Chris Goodall: LEDs (light-emitting diodes) have become cheap and effective. If you have any energy-guzzling halogen lights in your house – many people have them in kitchens and bathrooms – it makes good financial and carbon sense to replace as many as possible with their LED equivalents. They should last at least 10 years, meaning you avoid the hassle of buying new halogen bulbs every few months. Not only will your CO2 footprint fall, but because LEDs are so efficient, you will also help reduce the need for national grids to turn on the most expensive and polluting power stations at peak demand times on winter evenings. Frequent use of a tumble dryer will add to your energy bill to an extent that may surprise you. But when buying a new appliance, don’t assume you will benefit financially from buying the one with the lowest level of energy consumption. There’s often a surprising premium to really efficient fridges or washing machines. Consume less. Simply buying less stuff is a good route to lower emissions. A new woollen man’s suit may have a carbon impact equivalent to your home’s electricity use for a month. A single T-shirt may have caused emissions equal to two or three days’ typical power consumption. Buying fewer and better things has an important role to play. Turning our attention to the UK, climate change is already affecting parts of Britain, principally by increasing the risk of extreme flooding and heatwaves, and on Wednesday the government accepted almost all of the current and future risks set out by its official advisors, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The CCC’s report, published in July, concluded the UK was poorly prepared for global warming and set out six priority risk areas. The first two were rated as high risk now, with more action needed. Flooding already causes £1bn of damage every year on average but the risks will rise yet further as climate change leads to more intense rainfall, bringing floods to places not currently in danger. The number of households at significant risk of flooding will more than double to 1.9m by 2050, if the global temperature rises by 4C. The deadly heatwave of 2003, which peaked at 38.5C in the UK, will be a normal summer by the 2040s, leading to heat-related deaths more than tripling. There are currently no policies to ensure homes, schools, hospitals and offices remain tolerable in high heat. Severe water shortages are expected as summers get drier and, by the 2050s, will extend across the UK. If temperatures are driven up significantly, many places in the UK will have a demand for water 2.5 times greater than that available. Climate change is likely to drive food prices up, with extreme weather leading to lost crops and price shocks. About 40% of UK food is imported, making the UK vulnerable to droughts and floods driven by climate change around the world. The proportion of prime farmland is expected to fall from 38% to 9% with significant warming, and crop growing in eastern England and Scotland could be ended by degraded soil and water shortages. Warming seas are pushing key species northwards, which may affect the entire marine food chain. New dangers may invade the UK as the climate gets warmer and requires urgent research. “The impacts are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants,” the report states. “Higher temperatures will lead to an increased risk of the Asian tiger mosquito, the vector of Chikungunya virus, dengue fever and Zika virus. The current risk remains low, but may increase in the future.” The CCC also warned that climate-stoked wars and migration around the world could have very significant consequences for the UK, through disrupted trade and more military intervention overseas. On Wednesday, environment minister Lord Gardiner said Our changing climate is one of the most serious environmental challenges that we face as a nation and that is why we are taking action, from improving flood defences across the country to securing our critical food and water supplies. Professor Hugh Montgomery, at University College London added: Acting on climate change can also boost people’s health. If we get it right, our efforts to tackle climate change avoid some of these risks, and directly benefit health: renewable power doesn’t generate health-damaging pollutants, for example, while walking or cycling improves health.” And with that in mind, here come some more tips: We’ve had some great comments below the line this morning. If you have any questions for our head of environment, Damian Carrington, please post them there. We’ll hold an answer session at 1pm. Herewith some intriguing comments. Stefana Broadbent wonders about a “spiral of silence” caused by people fearing to speak out: Another Guardian commenter discusses the importance of finding common ground, regardless of wider political stances: And this commenter wonders about personal responsibility. And finally LordInsect asked for a graphic on carbon emissions. I’m happy to say we have two: And this: Before we move on to Europe and the UK, this is a neat piece of work from my colleague Nick Evershed, the Guardian’s head of data and interactives in Australia. It shows how much carbon we are emitting right now – and how much we have “left to burn” if we want to keep global warming within the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. Nick’s calculated that in just the 24 hour lifespan of this blog, the world will pump out more than 112m tons. Hard to visualise? Well let’s let the doomsday clock do the work: So in summary, we’ve been focussed on Africa over the past hour: rising sea levels in Alexandria disappearing glaciers in Mt Kenya an insurgency partially caused by climate change in west Africa and hungry people in the south And here’s another fact for our post-truth world: Since you’re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever – but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help.

If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ In South Africa meanwhile, an interesting distinction: while you might find plenty of climate change denial in western countries or oil powers, or even in the White House (from tomorrow), it’s not a common feature of local conversation here. Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, told me: In South Africa, there has been very little of the climate denialist narrative you still see in the US and elsewhere. The South African government has been vocal in its commitment to the fight against climate change for many years, and there is a genuine popular understanding of the problem and consequences of climate change. One reason for that is that ordinary people can already see the effects of climate change very clearly. The devastating drought that has plagued South Africa for the past two years, with ruinous knock-on effects on the rural economy and food prices, is a very real and tangible reminder of our vulnerability to climate change. We really are at the coalface of climate change, so to speak. I’ve been talking to Johannes Wedenig, country representative for Unicef in Malawi about the situation there. He says climate change is making the weather hotter and more variable. From 2000 to 2009 droughts effected 8.5 million people in Malawi, and floods affected 1.2 million. From 2010 to 2016 we have already reached 8.4 million people affected by drought and 875,000 by flooding. So we will see at least a third more over the decade if the trend continues. But I’ve seen from my own experience that it’s the variability of weather phenomena that poses the greatest challenges to farmers in Malawi, especially when combined with an already fragile situation. People are selling their last assets and so are going into the next cycle even poorer, and unpredictability makes it very hard to plan and adapt. Wedenig says these changes affect the poor disproportionately. I’ve travelled widely in Africa but when I got here last year I was really shocked by the amount of acutely malnourished children. You wouldn’t necessarily expect to see such a severe impact here but Malawi shows the impact of climate change compounded by other factors such as soil degradation, population pressure and an over-reliance on a single crop (food source) as a result of past policy decisions. My colleague John Vidal was in Malawi at the end of last year, and wrote movingly about the food shortages there. Here is his piece. In east Africa, concerns are growing that the continent’s second highest peak, Mt Kenya, could be totally ice free within decades. The United Nations Environmental Programme estimates that 80% of East Africa’s glaciers have been lost since 1900. Mt Kenya has lost 92% of its glacial clover over the last century. Scientists are divided over the precise causes of the steady retreat of the glaciers but many blame rising temperatures driven by climate change. The consequences have been dire for locals. Glacial melt is one of the contributors to river flow in the region and many rivers have been drying up in recent years. Seven million people depend on agriculture fed by the vital Mt Kenya water catchment area, which provides the bulk of the tea and coffee exports that are critical to Kenya’s economy. The area also hosts heavily visited national parks and reserves. Although Africa has made a negligible contribution to the greenhouse emissions that cause climate change, many parts of the continent are expected to bear a great burden from the results of climate change. Mathenge wa Iregi, who as a Gikuyu elder has spent many years offering prayers in the forests of Mt Kenya, says he does not need scientists to point out the dramatic changes upending people’s lives and considers the stance of climate-change skeptics like US president-elect Donald Trump baffling. You just need to open your eyes. Mt Kenya was once a striking and impressive site and we even named it in reference to the glacial cover. Everything has changed within our lifetime. And that is simply because we human beings do not respect nature. Guardian columnist George Monbiot is writing today on Trump and climate change. This is his stark take on things: Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. You can read his full piece here. Here are three more tips on how to save the planet from author Chris Goodall of Carbon Commentary: Old gas and oil boilers can be hugely wasteful. Even if your current boiler is working well, it’s worth thinking about a replacement if it is more than 15 years old. Your fuel use may fall by a third or more, repaying the cost in lower fuel bills. The distance you drive matters. Reducing the mileage of the average new car from 15,000 to 10,000 miles a year will save more than a tonne of CO2, about 15% of the average person’s footprint. If car travel is vital, think about leasing an electric vehicle when your existing car comes to the end of its life. A battery car will save you money on fuel, particularly if you drive tens of thousands of miles a year. Even though the electricity to charge your car will be partly generated in a gas or coal power station, electric vehicles are so much more efficient that total CO2 emissions will fall. But bear in mind that the manufacture of an electric car may produce more emissions than the vehicle produces in its lifetime. Rather than buying a new electric vehicle, it may be better to keep your old car on the road by maintaining it properly and using it sparingly. The same is true for many other desirable items; the energy needed to make a new computer or phone is many times the amount used to power it over its lifetime. Apple says 80% of the carbon footprint of a new laptop comes from manufacturing and distribution, not use in the home. Further west, the contraction of Lake Chad over the past four decades has created a very different set of problems for surrounding countries, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Some experts even blame the rise of Boko Haram on the disruption to traditional ways of life that the changing landscape has brought about. These maps show just how the lake has diminished over the decades: Patrick Kingsley visited the region for the Guardian at the end of last year, and found locals blaming the climate as much as the insurgents for the catastrophe that had befallen them. If the Lake Chad water was normal all these problems [with Boko Haram] would be eliminated economically, because nobody would have time to do all these things,” said Modu Amsami, a displaced person from northeast Nigeria You can read Patrick’s piece here. Our Egypt correspondent Ruth Michaelson has been to Alexandria to investigate the impact of rising sea levels on the city. Ruth writes: On the southern tip of the Mediterranean, the coastal waters are inching closer to buildings and flooded ancient structures, including the Greco-Roman tombs at Anfushi. Seawater seeping into the groundwater has also made the fragile ground more unstable, resulting in the alarming collapse of some of the city’s buildings. The UN estimates that global sea levels will rise between 13cm and 68cm by 2050, and say that the Mediterranean is particularly vulnerable – by 2080, up to 120,000 people living near the sea could be affected by rising waters if no action is taken to protect them. Rising sea levels and seawater temperatures will also increase the salinity of the Nile, Egypt’s primary water source, and increasingly salty water sources could destroy farmland across the Nile Delta. In 2007, the World Bank estimated that 10.5% of Egypt’s population could be displaced by rising waters caused by climate change. She visited the small town of Rosetta – famous for the stone – and found locals struggling to adapt to the unignorable advances of the sea. You have to do what you have to do, and don’t think about the bad weather – the good weather comes from God,” a local fisherman, Ahmed Mohamed Gowayed, told her. “Last year the storm destroyed palm trees, buildings, cars – older people in their seventies said they’d never seen anything like it in their lives. If the weather continues like this I will build a stronger kiosk. You can read Ruth’s piece full piece here. We’re delighted to be working with both Tumblr and Univision today. For a version of this blog in Spanish, check out Univision’s work here. And to contribute to Tumblr’s unique exercise in creating a sort of “climate change quilt”, follow this link. We’re also on Twitter, using #globalwarning as a hashtag ... Right, that’s the introductions done. Later we’ll focus on climate change in the UK and Europe, but before that we’ll turn the focus to a part of the world where climate change is having one of the greatest impacts: Africa. Before we go any further, let’s look at how climate change is actually impacting parts of the world. Run the slider across to see how Arctic temperatures have changed over the past 40 years This one shows the dramatic decline of Lake Chad in west Africa, which has been blamed for large scale migration. And finally, the gradual melt of the ice sheet in Greenland. Carbon expert Chris Goodall says individual actions DO make a difference. Here are three of his suggestions for individual action that will cumulatively make a real impact on humankind’s carbon emissions: 1 Air travel is usually the largest component of the carbon footprint of frequent flyers. A single return flight from London to New York – including the complicated effects on the high atmosphere – contributes to almost a quarter of the average person’s annual emissions. The easiest way to make a big difference is to go by train or not take as many flights. 2 The second most important lifestyle change is to eat less meat, with particular emphasis on meals containing beef and lamb. Cow and sheep emit large quantities of methane, a powerful global warming gas. A vegan diet might make as much as a 20% difference to your overall carbon impact but simply cutting out beef will deliver a significant benefit on its own. 3 Home heating is next. Poorly insulated housing requires large quantities of energy to heat. If you have properly insulated the loft and filled the cavity wall, the most important action you can take is to draft-proof the house, something you can do yourself. Those with solid brick or stone walls will also benefit from adding insulation, but the financial benefits are unlikely to cover the cost of doing the work, over time. First things first – the facts. I know this is the post-fact era, and it’s become rather unfashionable to grub around looking for the truth. But here goes anyway: 1) Warming is happening fast. No doubt about it. For most of the 20th century, average global temperatures bimbled around the 13.5C mark. Now they are closer to 15C. The UK’s Met Office has produced a nice visual of this which really brings home how static temperatures were for a long period, before the past 20 years or so: 2) Scientists agree we are doing this to ourselves. Often good journalism involves balancing arguments. If you quote a Democrat, you need a Republican for balance. If you quote someone in favour of chocolate biscuits, you want a counter view. This has leached into climate journalism, but the vast majority of scientists support the hypothesis that manmade action is contributing to climate change. As this chart makes clear, if we want to strike a fair balance of voices in reporting climate change, we need to speak to more than 30 people who believe in manmade climate change before we give a platform to a sceptic. So we will do that today. We will hear from 30 or so people in the former camp. And we will remind you of what the world’s most famous climate sceptic, Donald Trump, has said. 3) BUT … THERE IS HOPE. There are many great things going on. We’re going to hear lots about these too: what is happening right now, and what you can do to join the global movement. Carbon emissions are flatlining (but need to start falling). Renewable capacity has increased exponentially around the world. In an article we have just published, climate expert Chris Goodall writes: 2016 was the year in which it finally became obvious that the world had the technology to solve the problem. Even as the political environment has darkened, the reasons have strengthened for believing that a complete transition to low-carbon energy is practical and affordable within one generation. Humanity stands at a fork in the road, with one route descending towards disaster and the other climbing towards a brighter future. The route taken depends on whether the world can tame global warming, which threatens a violent end to the mild and stable climate the world has enjoyed since the start of civilisation. Many fear the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US president on Friday threatens to push us down the dark path. That’s understandable: he has called global warming a hoax and appointed climate-change deniers and oil barons to key posts. But the unpredictable Trump and his team have already stepped back from a threat to abandon the global climate deal agreed in Paris in 2015. Hope remains – just – that with the right advice and pressure, Trump may see the challenge of climate change as the great opportunity it also represents. Beating climate change requires nothing less than rewiring the global economy to run on zero-carbon energy – work that must start now but will take decades. As the climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern tells the Guardian: “The urgency and scale is not sufficiently understood.” But this titanic challenge also offers extraordinary opportunities: trillion dollar markets for green technology and the prospect of a clean, sustainable and fair world. The US is the most vibrant crucible for new technology the world has seen and embracing the transformation to a green economy would deliver jobs and prosperity to many Americans. Will Trump the dealmaker grasp the opportunity before Trump the climate-change denier throws it on a fossil fuel bonfire? Grabbing the chance would be a great way to “make America great again”, as many US cities, states and US businesses already realise. In contrast, not doing so will help make China great again, as its extraordinary transformation into a climate leader accelerates. Indeed the rest of the world’s nations have shown they remain resolute in pushing on, with or without the US. Even Saudi Arabia, which for years frustrated global climate talks, is now backing the renewables revolution with billions. The prize of beating climate change is a glittering one and still just within reach. Global carbon emissions have levelled off. But that only means we are no longer accelerating towards the climate cliff edge – just speeding along at a steady 100mph towards the “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” projected by the world’s scientists. A foretaste of those severe weather impacts has already arrived in many places, via scorching heatwaves and floods made far more likely by the overheating planet. To avoid climate breakdown, emissions must fall to zero in a few decades at most and that means ramping up action right now. Given the scale of the challenge, people can feel powerless to make a difference. But ask the key players around the world what individuals can do and one answer recurs more than cutting down on flying, giving up meat and saving energy: demand action from your elected representatives today. Hello and welcome to this live climate change special, in which we will be reporting from all seven continents on the climate change already underway – and the promise of solutions – in one 24-hour period. The plan is this: starting in London, we will generally follow the sun as daybreak falls around the world. We’ll be in Europe, Africa and the Middle East for the next few hours before crossing the Atlantic to look at the Americas during their morning. And finally we’ll move down to Sydney to hear about Asia-Pacific as that part of the world wakes up on Friday morning. All building towards Donald Trump’s big moment in Washington later in the day. We’re teaming up with social network Tumblr and Spanish-language US broadcaster Univision to cast the conversational net far and wide. Of course, Trump is on record as questioning the science behind climate change, and the link between the warming planet and the transformation of our weather patterns. But we’ll hear from people who, unlike Trump, live on the front line of climate change –in Bangladesh, Egypt, Canada, Bolivia, Malawi, the South Pacific – parts of the world where climate sceptics (or doubters, if you prefer that word) are few and far between. Already today we have heard from more than a dozen top global warming experts who pinpoint why Trump’s revisionism is not just dangerous but a self-inflicted wound. And we have heard Xi Jinping, China’s president, wax lyrical about the urgency of the moment: There is only one Earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland ... It’s not all gloom though. There’s a tremendous amount of work – science, innovation, activism and diplomacy – that should give readers hope. We’ll be highlighting the saviour technology that can yet make a big difference and the little things you can do in your life to join the climate movement. Other highlights will include a quiz, a doomsday carbon countdown clock, a Facebook live attempt to sketch climate change, and a film from the bottom of the earth. Our icons will indicate what each post is about, whether it’s drought, heat, oceans, flooding, food or ice melt – or just advice or commentary. So drop in from time to time, and see how we’re getting on. After all, in the time it’s taken you to read this, we’ve churned out another 100,000 tons of carbon. Next up will be Damian Carrington our head of environment, on why this is such a critical juncture for our species, and indeed every species on this planet.

That was the <strong>biggest drop since April 2012</strong> and far worse than forecasts for a 0.1% dip in a Reuters poll of economists.</p> <p>But taking the final three months of the year together retail sales were up 1.2%, the Office for National Statistics said. That will buoy hopes that consumers continued to drive a pretty solid pace of overall economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Commenting on the figures, ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: <br> </p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Retailers saw a strong end to 2016 with sales in the final quarter up 5.6% on the same period last year, although the amount bought fell between November and December once the effects of Christmas are removed. There were some notably strong figures from smaller retailers, in particular butchers, who reported a significant boost in sales in the run-up to Christmas.” <br></p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, called it a “disastrous December” and pointed to the effects of a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/17/uk-inflation-hits-two-year-high"">pick-up in inflation last month</a>.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>We know from the CPI [inflation] data earlier in the week that prices rose more than expected in December and now we also know that sales volumes fell.

You’ll never guess which Davos regular has just landed a swanky job..... Our work here is done. Thanks for reading and commenting through the week. Here’s Larry Elliott’s news story on today’s key developments: Here’s what we learned in Davos this week: Tschüss! The World Economic Forum is wrapping up now, which is just as well as my laptop is seizing up after a week of constant activity. The co-chairs of this year’s event have been speaking; Save the Children’s Helle Thorning-Schmidt cites Tuesday’s speech by president Xi as a key moment: Perhaps the most interesting part of Kissinger’s appearance was his advice to Donald Trump to redefine America’s role in the world. Here’s the full quotes, courtesy of CNBC: “One of the major achievements or impacts of President Obama was to withdraw America from some positions in which it was overextended but also to create the feel that America was withdrawing from the world even in places in which over extension would not apply and where its contribution remains essential. “So President Trump will have to find a definition of the American role that answers the concern of many parts of the world that America was giving up its indispensable role of leadership in many countries - and major contribution in others - and define what and where America can lead and where it must contribute and in that help in the creation of an international order.” On Brexit, Kissinger says it could be used in a creative way -- to create Europe and America in the Atlantic partnership. It could seek to address the problem that some of the key issues in Europe, such as the economy and security, are very difficult to solve in a forum where unanimity is the absolute requirement. One answer could be to create subgroups on issues like finance and security, where decisions could be made on the basis of support from countries who would carry the greatest burden, Kissinger continues. In such a system, Britain could reenter Europe, and play a function linking Europe and America. This could allow countries to act with the same “moral conviction” as we saw in the early days of the Atlantic Alliance. The Atlantic Partnership is crucially importance, says Kissinger, in avoiding a return to the problems that used to characterise Europe. It needs to be reconstructed, but with the attitude that it is the key element of both US and European policy. On the Middle East, Kissinger says it is important that progress is made at the Syrian peace talks in Astana, as a precursor for further progress. Those talks start next week, and are organised by Russia and Turkey. Any solution will have to include the United States, he adds. Q: What advice would you give president Trump about Russia, if you were secretary of state? America and Russia seem to be making the worst assumptions about each other today, Henry Kissinger replies. Trump has spoken about de-escalating the tension in the relationship, and Kissinger agrees with this ‘general attitude. I think Russia is a country with a very special history - 11 time zones, touching Asia, he Middle East, and Europe, Kissinger continues. It has been the cause of many tensions, but also maintained the equilibrium in the world Q: What advice would you give president Trump? President Trump must find a definition of America’s role in the world, and decide in what way America can lead, what it can contribute, to help create an international world order, Kissinger replies. Henry Kissinger is now joining the delegates at Davos, by video link, to discuss the state of the world today. He starts by paying tribute to Shimon Peres, the Israeli statesman and Davos favourite who died in September 2016. Q: What conclusions do you draw for President Xi’s speech on Tuesday? Important assertion by China that it will participate in the construction of a world order. The world order which we were familiar is disintegrating in some respects, Kissinger says. President Xi has put forward a concept of international order that must be discussed, Kissinger adds. Rosberg is telling an audience in Davos about what it takes to make it to the top. He says failure and suffering can be a “gift”, depending on how you look at it. Losses, failure, are not always a bad thing. They can help you. I can look back [at my career in F1] and say I’ve ticked all the boxes. I find that life has more to offer than driving around in circles. He says that among the things that helped him succeed in his F1 career were jet lag training and keeping his family life simple. This year I realised how much my private life had an impact... simplifying it so that it took the least possible energy from me, so that I could 100% focus on the job of racing. It really made a difference. F1 champ Rosberg is giving an interview at Davos. Watch it here. Roberto Azevedo, director general of the World Trade Organization, is concerned about the tone of some of the conversations at Davos. Specifically he’s concerned that talk about protectionism and trade wars could lead to a crisis. Speaking after a meeting of trade ministers at Davos, attended by 29 WTO members, he said: I’ve heard a lot in Davos about trade wars. That would destroy jobs, not create jobs. We must definitely avoid talking ourselves into a crisis.” The BBC’s Call the Midwife gets a mention by the Davos (non Brit) panel on the hospital of the future. Elizabeth Nabel, president of Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Health Care describes the programme as “charming” as she discusses her belief that health care should be provided as much as possible at home in the community. As the world’s political and business leaders debate inequality and globalisation in Davos, Harrods is making some changes after it was criticised by a union. The luxury department store has agreed to let staff keep 100% of the money raised from restaurant tips following a campaign by the United Voices of the World union. Previously the retailer kept 50% of the discretionary 12.5% service charge automatically added to diners’ bills. It is also reducing its service charge rate to 10%. The Guardian’s Zoe Wood has the full story: Away from Davos for a moment, but on the subject of Brexit, the Gambia’s new president has been speaking to Sky News: The panel on the hospital of the future is underway. Panelists are pondering what a hospital in a major city is going to be like in 2027. The broad conclusion is that it’s going to be very different. Shamsheer Vayalil, managing director at Abu Dhabi based VPS Healthcare, says that in 10 years time, there won’t be standalone hospitals. There will be gyms, cafes, business meetings in the same place. Larry Elliott, the Guardian’s economics editor, has the full story on how the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, is blaming Tony Blair for Brexit: Third time lucky? Currently underway is a debate on mental health and what might be done to mitigate the consequences of mental illness. Also coming up: The hospital of the future at 13.00 UK time The global security outlook at 14.15 UK time A conversation with Nico Rosberg, 2016 Formula 1 World Champion at 14.30 UK time Henry Kissinger on the world in 2017 at 15.30 UK time Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services, says it is not surprising that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, François Hollande, have chosen to stay away from Davos this year: It is not difficult to understand why, for some European leaders, Davos is now a no-no. To be seen by their voters junketing with business chiefs in a luxury resort would merely serve to heighten the populist rage that has been shaking the foundations of the political order in Europe. Admittedly, [UK prime minister] Mrs May addressed the meeting but she was in the special position of having a job to do to persuade corporate managers that Brexit would not render the UK a less friendly environment for business. The most significant political attendee at this year’s event, he says, was China’s leader Xi Jinping: President Xi’s attendance was perhaps the most significant of these political comings and goings, though. Beijing surely recognises that Mr Trump’s approach to international trade could well result in the reversal of the globalisation process that has so favoured China’s economic development. By presenting himself as the champion of free markets, he was probably hoping to win good will towards China among the multinational globalisers. The World Economic Forum is not giving up on the idea of globalisation that works for everyone: The panel ends with Christine Lagarde, IMF chief, urging advanced economies to do more to support the developing world. She says: Growth is not sustainable if it is not inclusive. She singles out Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7% of its GDP on overseas aid. All countries should adhere to that target, and do more to help. Otherwise we will be dealing with massive inequality issues at all levels. Q: There is concern that there might be no agreement, two years after triggering Brexit, leading to a cliff-edge. How concerned would you be about that? Wolfgang Schauble says it would be “a disaster for all of us if that happened.” He adds that he is “totally convinced” London will remain an important financial centre for Europe after Brexit. And he believes that a deal can be done in two years. Wolfgang Schauble isn’t convinced by Hammond’s threat to leave the economic mainstream. The Financial Times’s Martin Wolf, who is moderating the panel, asks the German finance minister to comment on the idea that Britain will become “Singapore on Thames” Schauble says: I can’t see that the UK, this great nation, would compare itself with Singapore. If America aggravates some of our largest lenders, and raise our deficits, quite frankly that puts even more pressure on the dollar, Larry Fink adds. That’s a very hard thing to navigate. He explains: Right now the biggest lender is Japan, the second biggest lender is China. We need to be paying quite a bit of attention to our relationships worldwide, as the biggest borrower in the world. Larry Fink, the head of US investment group BlackRock, says the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote have both had an immediate boost to consumer optimism. These votes have had an immediate impact on families, they feel they have a voice now and their voice has changed policy, so they’re feeling happier and spending more. Whether they are right or wrong they think the old policies were wrong for them. We’ll find out if they’re right, Fink says. Philip Hammond then warns his audience at Davos that Britain could quit the economic mainstream if it doesn’t get a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU. Our “strong preference is that we remain within the European economic mainstream”, with reciprocal access to each others markets, and Britain “continuing to operate to European norms and regulatory standards,” says Hammond. However.... But if we are driven out of that market, and denied access to our most important market, we will reinvent ourselves and find a new way of being competitive. Hammond reminds us that Britain already works longer hours, to ensure that our lower productivity doesn’t undermine competitiveness He doesn’t spell out what the ‘economic mainstream’ means, but I think he’s hinting at lower corporate tax, a bonfire of regulations and other measures to make Britain more attractive to companies. Philip Hammond goes next. He says Britain has confounded sceptics who thought the British economy would suffer an immediate shock after voting to leave the UK. He repeats his prediction that inflation will rise this year due to the depreciation in the pound. And he then lays into Tony Blair for allowing citizens from the eight eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004 to have full access to Britain. It is important to understand the drivers of the Brexit decision, Hammond says. They are not “one and the same” as the drivers that led to the election of president Trump. There was no anti-trade or anti globalisation rhetoric in the campaign - one of the central tenets of the Leave campaign was that Britain should do more trade with the rest of the world. Hammond says: It was absolutely the opposite of the anti-trade rhetoric that we heard in the United States. But what there was clearly was a strong strand of feeling against uncontrolled migration. And I lay the responsibility for that squarely at the door of prime minister Blair who failed to impose transitional regime in the UK in 2004 So while other countries in Europe smoothly transitioned the A8 members and the freedom of movement from A8 members Britain took the full force of the tide in 2004, and that created a public perception which we still haven’t shaken off to this day. Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, says Germany would suffer if there was a decline in free trade. Brexit will not have a big impact on the German economy this year, though. Christine Lagarde speaks first. She says there are good signs in the global economy - for a start, the IMF isn’t revising down its growth forecasts any more Global growth is expected to rise from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. Japan is getting stronger, and Europe is in a recovery cycle. And the IMF has revised up the US, because of Donald Trump’s proposed tax reforms. However, it’s not clear how this fiscal stimulus will be combined with trade treasures, Lagarde warns. This is “Something to be explored and probably not overall a net positive”, she warns. Philip Hammond has now hotfooted it across the conference to join a panel discussion on the global economic outlook, with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Japan’s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda, Wall Street titan Larry Fink and German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble. Here’s a live feed: Official figures for the how UK retailers fared over the crucial Christmas period are out and will not make pretty reading for the industry. Contrasting with the largely upbeat tone of retailers’ trading updates, the official statistics suggest retail sales volumes dropped 1.9% in December from the month before. That was the biggest drop since April 2012 and far worse than forecasts for a 0.1% dip in a Reuters poll of economists. But taking the final three months of the year together retail sales were up 1.2%, the Office for National Statistics said. That will buoy hopes that consumers continued to drive a pretty solid pace of overall economic growth in the fourth quarter. Commenting on the figures, ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: Retailers saw a strong end to 2016 with sales in the final quarter up 5.6% on the same period last year, although the amount bought fell between November and December once the effects of Christmas are removed. There were some notably strong figures from smaller retailers, in particular butchers, who reported a significant boost in sales in the run-up to Christmas.” Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, called it a “disastrous December” and pointed to the effects of a pick-up in inflation last month. We know from the CPI [inflation] data earlier in the week that prices rose more than expected in December and now we also know that sales volumes fell. This is likely to be the theme for the rest of the year - higher prices will reduce disposable income and hurt consumer spending growth.” The pound has dropped on the news and is currently at $1.2290, down 0.4% on the day against the dollar. It is down 0.3% against the euro, at €1.1542. Another interesting angle – Hammond told the panel that he thinks the Brexit deal can be done in two years, but there might have to be an ‘interim’ arrangement if a final trade deal isn’t ready. Here’s Reuters’ take on Philip Hammond’s migration comments: British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday it was an “open question” whether migrants from the European Union would enjoy easier access to Britain after Brexit than those from other parts of the world. “That could be a subject for the negotiations. What we have said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement,” Hammond said in response to a question at a panel discussion in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Could Britain leave the EU and rejoin in the future? Hammond thinks this is unlikely, as it would mean joining the euro - a red line issue for the UK. And he warns that the slump in the pound is going to push the cost of living higher. British people are starting to feel that through increased inflation, and we’ll see more of that through this year. That’s the mechanism that allows economic shocks to be handled in a smooth way. Hammond was also asked about the issue of EU citizens currently living in the UK He says Europe rejected the idea of an immediate reciprocal deal, because nothing can be discussed until everything is discussed. The 2.4 million EU citizens in Britain are welcome, Hammond says. Provided we can be assured of a reciprocal deal for the 1.2 million UK citizens in Europe, it will be settled. More Hammond: On to geopolitics. The change of administration in Washington is a very big issue for the UK, and has introduced even more uncertainty for the EU than Brexit, Hammond continues. And the crucial issue is Europe’s relationship with Russia, and the question of whether the security provided by America changes. It is not an exaggeration that for some eastern partners of the EU, security is a much bigger issue than economics. We want to find the best people from around the world, Barclays CEO Jes Staley tells the panel. One of the reasons for the City’s success is the acceptance that financial companies can being talent from anywhere. Staley doesn’t think the UK people want that to stop. Mario Monti says there has been “a fundamental change in a small time” in Britain’s attitude to EU migration. He reminds us that the UK was one of the members pushing to allow more countries to join the bloc a couple of decades ago. The two are linked, Philip Hammond shoots back. The attitude in the UK now on EU migration is absolutely for sure derived from the mistake that Blair made to open the floodgates in 2004. More from Hammond on migration: What we’ve said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement. Any EU national can simply change his place of residence from Bulgaria or Romania to the UK, Hammond adds, and we can’t accept that any more. But the UK will still need migrants for its economy, and it will still welcome them. Hammond insists Britain isn’t anti-migration. There might be a few people in the UK whose view is the migrants don’t come in, but it’s absolutely not the majority view, he says, adding: It is very important to the British people that we control our borders, but most of them do not want to use that control to shut the borders, they simply want to have the control. Professor Ngaire Woods then gives a passionate call to the government not to include students in its migration controls. She says that Britain needs to be at the front of the knowledge economy to succeed. Oxford is fighting against top US universities to attract the best students, and Brexit could make this much harder. If we have a tone in Britain that it’s less welcoming of immigrants then it can’t attract the best talent in the world then it doesn’t become Global Britain, it becomes Doors Shut Britain.” Woods says we should see overseas students as purchases of Britain’s ‘fantastic’ education services, rather then including them in the immigration numbers. If we make them part of Britain’s immigration debate we’ve smashing our own kneecaps before even beginning the race.... Don’t kneecap your best asset. Let us thrive, make sure that immigration policies tell the world that Britain is open and welcoming to the best most entrepreneurial, energetic talent from all over, without restraint and constraint. Professor Ngaire Woods, professor of global economic governance at Oxford University, tells the Davos panel that successful Brexit negotiations can’t be done in two years, and criticises the “gloating” among leave supporters. Woods says that May and Hammond are taking a positive, constructive approach – but not everyone in their party is taking the same view. There are still factions that are gloating about Brexit – and that unfortunately takes an unconstructive tone. That’s because the Brexit vote caused the sterling devalation giving an immediate boost to exports, but the costs of a hard Brexit won’t be felt for two years. Politically, this is a big call on both sides, Woods continues. The cool constructive approach that the PM and chancellor are taking needs to quickly infect all their party and people who supported Brexit. And she warns that the two-year timetable laid out under Article 50 may not be achievable. “The ideal would be a 10 year period in which you could put each piece together and end up in a Churchillian world of a more coherent EU without Britain, and Britain as a constructive friend sitting alongside it”. Mario Monti, the former Italian PM and European commissioner, is also on the panel - and is roasting David Cameron for calling last year’s EU referendum. Monti starts by welcoming the “clarity” that Britain has given about its Brexit plans in recent days. But then he attacks Cameron for calling the referendum “in the interest of his position in his party”. “He put his country and the whole of Europe on the line to achieve this” The consequences have been rather devastating, not only for him personally but because the whole political system in the UK has been blocked, paralysed and made uncertain. This means that other European leaders who play the game of attacking the EU for personal interests will “find it an admonishment to be a bit more careful”, Monti concludes. Hammond adds that it would be economically “sub-optimal” if countries and companies had to start precautionary spending in case Brexit turned out badly. For example, France would also have to invest in new systems at its own borders. Philip Hammond starts by telling Davos that Theresa May’s Brexit speech on Tuesday was an important step forward. We’ve now set out an agenda that lets this become a shared problem that has to be solved. One of the key challenges is the ‘pretty rigid’ timetable laid down by the EU treaties, the chancellor says. He still expects to serve the Article 50 notice by the end of March, whatever the Supreme Court rules next week. Hammond says there are many issues to consider; Britain will need significant new infrastructure at our borders if we change our customs arrangements, and new IT systems if the migration rules change. Hammond says that he hopes to begin “constructive engagement” with the EU once the Article 50 notice is served. It will become clear, I hope pretty quickly, that there is a shared ambition to get to an end state arrangement that will mean maximising the reciprocal access to each other’s markets and the level of co-operation across this range of non-economic areas as well. That means the fog gradually clears, and businesses have more certainty, Hammond adds. Philip Hammond’s session begins with an audience question – who thinks Britain is not going to leave the EU? No one puts their hand up... The message has finally got through, says Hammond. Former foreign office minister Mark Malloch-Brown reckons Theresa May’s cabinet is the “B team”. Speaking on the same panel as Pascal Lamy, Malloch-Brown says: “In the history of the Tory party, they have never been able to form a second cabinet if the first one falls under a bus. If the first one (David Cameron’s) gets knocked out because it makes a mess of Brexit you get the B team.” Pascal Lamy, the former EU trade commissioner and former director general of the World Trade Organisation, has an interesting theory about the government’s Brexit plan: it is all a ruse to disguise the fact that Britain is not going to leave the EU. Speaking at a Clifford Chance breakfast in Davos, Lamy says: “It is like world war two where the allies intoxicated the Germans into thinking the landings were going to take place in northern France when in fact they were going to take place in western France. That’s what’s happening here.”* You have a fake foreign minister, then you have a message that Brexit means Brexit, then you choose the most costly option so that at some stage people realise that the costs are not worth it.” * He’s referring to Operation Bodyguard, in which the Allies persuaded Germany that the Normandy landings were a diversion. Lamy adds that while the lawyers are divided about whether the Article 50 process can be stopped once it has started, the process may drown in its own complexity. The divorce proceedings, he says, will be “long, obscure, bumpy and probably nasty”. That’s why the idea that Theresa May is running a Black Cabinet operation of the sort mounted by Churchill in 1944 can’t be ruled out, Lamy argued.

Today we’ll be hearing a lot more about Brexit, the global economy and Donald Trump, as the presidential inauguration reminds delegates that the world is changing – and not the way most would like. The UK’s chancellor, Philip Hammond, is about to give us his views on Britain’s future relationship with the EU. Barclays CEO Jes Staley is also on the panel, at bank chiefs ponder whether to start moving jobs overseas. That session starts at 9.15am Davos time, or 8.15am GMT. Hammond’s going to be busy too – he’s then appearing on a panel on the global economic outlook alongside IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Japan’s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda, Wall Street titan Larry Fink and German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble. There’s a rather subdued feeling at WEF today; some business chiefs have left early so they can attend Trump’s swearing-in. Others are simply wondering what 2017 has in store for them.... Henry Kissinger will have some guidance; he’s giving his views on the state of the world at 4.30pm CET. NHS chief executive Simon Stephens is also in town, appearing on a panel about hospitals of the future at 2pm CET. Plus there are panels on science, security and the Middle East to keep an eye on too...",26544,Graeme Wearden in Davos,2017-01-23T06:00:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/graemewearden"">Graeme Wearden</a> in Davos",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The four will sit down for a private coffee and tea reception in the White House’s regal Blue Room. 10.30am: The Trumps and the Obamas will take the presidential limousine to the West Front of the US Capitol for the ceremony. 11.30am: The inauguration ceremony will begin. 12pm: The chief justice of the supreme court, John Roberts, will administer the presidential oath for Trump, who will then make his inaugural address. 12.45pm: The Obamas will fly off in a helicopter to Andrews airfield. The remainder of the day consists of the inaugural parade, a luncheon and, later in the evening, the inaugural balls. Hillary Clinton will be present at the ceremony, in keeping with tradition that all living former first families attend. Speaking of first families, here’s a look at the new one. However, more than 30 members of Congress will be boycotting the event in protest against Trump. In a column for the Guardian, congresswoman Barbara Lee explains why she won’t be there.

Last night saw fierce clashes in Washington DC in front of the National Press Club, the venue for the DeploraBall, an event hosted to celebrate Trump’s victory (with a name inspired by Clinton’s reference to Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables”). Many of the guests are believed to be associated with the “alt-right”, a far-right movement in the US that has praised Trump. Protesters were blocked by police but called attendees “fascists” and “racists”. Meanwhile, a host of celebrities attended a protest in New York outside Trump Tower. Alec Baldwin performed his Saturday Night Live impression of the soon-to-be president and rallied the crowd. Amber Jamieson has provided a guide to protests happening today and tomorrow here. DeploraBall: Trump lovers and haters clash at Washington DC event Pre-presidential party Trump delivered a speech on Thursday night in an event dripping with symbolism. Standing on the Lincoln Memorial steps, close to where Martin Luther King declared “I have dream” in 1963, Trump rallied the crowd with “make America great again” chants before a firework display spelled the words U-S-A, as the Battle Hymn of the Republic rang out. Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down performed at the event. On eve of inauguration, Trump addresses nation in shadow of Lincoln ‘We could’ve avoided President Trump’ The road to Trump’s presidency had many alternative routes but we missed all of them, writes Rebecca Solnit. From failing to address climate change to the capitulation of the media, Solnit argues, we’ve missed many off-ramps on the “highway to hell”. “Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tires and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are.” We could’ve avoided President Donald Trump. Now, we must learn the lessons Women’s March Come Saturday, a crowd of more than 200,000 is expected to descend on Washington to protest against the Trump presidency. For women who are on the fence, Lucia Graves has outlined 29 reasons to attend the rally on Saturday. However, not every woman was dismayed by Trump’s victory. Rebecca Nelson spoke to conservative women who are glad to see Trump in the White House and have no interest in protesting. Beyond the US, there will be solidarity marches held in more than 17 countries across the globe in protest of Trump’s election. A panel of Guardian writers have explained how they will protest from joining the UK women’s march to talking about sexual assault in Washington. While the march has gained international traction, Micah White, the co-creator of the Occupy Movement, said it takes a lot more than “raising awareness and getting media attention” to start a true revolutionary movement. In his piece for the Guardian, he outlines how the Women’s March could grow into something more sustained beyond Saturday. But it involves knowing one’s history, learning from the past, and taking the fight to the ballot box. And finally … In the wake of Donald Trump’s win – a tremendous political and cultural loss for American women – the Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti will be launching a newsletter, This Week in the Patriarchy.

Trump has also pledged to suspend America’s intake of Syrian refugees, who are already subjected to substantial security vetting before they enter the country, and it seems likely the president will move forward with this promise within the next few days. Coupled with Trump’s infamous promise to erect a wall across the entire southern border, it remains unclear just how much damage he will do to some of the world’s most vulnerable people in the name of border defense. Oliver Laughland Gender Trump didn’t mention gender issues in his inaugural speech. But in the days leading up to his swearing-in, his transition team unveiled a plan to eliminate $480m in Violence Against Women grants and his nomination for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, refused to commit to upholding the Obama administration’s aggressive stance on campus sexual assault or the rights of trans students. Republicans in Congress have moved swiftly to repeal Obamacare, which expanded contraception access and prohibited insurers from charging women more for health care, and to cut off Planned Parenthood’s participation in Medicaid.

A new first family will have taken their place. Here’s a bit about the Trumps, with notes on the roles each family member may play in the administration.</p>    <h2>Melania Trump, 46</h2> <p>Wife of Donald. Born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia in eastern Europe, she was sufficiently successful as a model that she sometimes worked under only her first name, and toiled as an undocumented immigrant in the United States before landing a work visa in 1997, according to an <a draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/melania-trump-was-paid-modeling-before-work-visa-records-show"">Associated Press investigation</a>. She met her future husband at a Fashion Week party in New York City. The couple will celebrate their 12th anniversary on 22 January, two days after he becomes president. She has said that as first lady she would like to be “very traditional – like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy”. She also plans to combat online bullying and harassment. She will remain in New York City through the end of the school year with her son with Trump, Barron, 10, and is expected to play a minimal role in the administration. </p> <h2>Donald Trump Jr, 39</h2>    <p>Donald Trump’s eldest son, he is himself a father of five, with his wife, Vanessa Kay Haydon, a former model. A reality TV star (The Apprentice) like his father, he has been tapped to head the Trump Organization – the family business empire – with his brother, Eric, aided by a longtime company executive. Trump Jr is not expected to have a role in his father’s administration; indeed, his new position as co-head of the Trump Organization would seem to preclude, under ethics rules and traditions, his speaking with his father about the business and his hearing from his father about government. Trump Jr <a href=""http://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/03/03/listen-donald-trump-jr-and-pro-confederate-whit/208993"">drew ire</a> during the campaign for agreeing to an interview with a prominent white nationalist and for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/donald-trump-jnr-compares-refugees-poisoned-skittles-twitter-reacted"">comparing</a> Syrian refugees to Skittles.

With his brother, Don Jr, Eric is to lead the Trump Organization, and is due to have no role in the Trump administration.

Like his brother, he is a big-game hunter.</p> <h2>Ivanka Trump, 35</h2>    <p>Trump’s eldest daughter, and like Don Jr and Eric the daughter of her father’s first wife Ivana, a Czech-born former fashion model. Ivanka converted to Orthodox Judaism to marry businessman Jared Kushner, with whom she has three children. She is a fashion executive and like her brothers has appeared on The Apprentice. As an executive with the Trump organization, she managed projects including the recently opened Trump hotel in the Old Post Office building in downtown Washington DC, but she has said she will divest from the family company, owing to her husband’s role in the Trump administration. The nature of her divestment is not clear; it has been described by Trump transition officials as “converting” her equity into fixed payments. Ivanka Trump has rebutted speculation that she would act as a de facto first lady. “I think it’s an inappropriate observation,” she told ABC News. “There is one first lady, and she’ll do remarkable things.” </p> <h2>Jared Kushner, 36</h2>    <p>Husband of Ivanka Trump. Raised in New Jersey and the grandchild of Holocaust survivors, he has a bachelor’s degree from Harvard and a law degree from New York University. He took over his family’s real estate firm after his father was imprisoned on a federal felony conviction for witness tampering and tax evasion. Kushner is also owner and publisher of the New York Observer, and has said he is in the process of withdrawing from both the real estate firm and the newspaper as part of his transition to senior adviser to his father-in-law. Despite his lack of political experience, he played a key behind-the-scenes role in Trump’s presidential campaign, guiding personnel and strategy decisions, and will play the role of senior adviser to the president in the Trump White House, presuming he is not found to have breached federal <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/09/jared-kushner-senior-adviser-donald-trump"">anti-nepotism laws</a>. </p> <p><strong>Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump</strong></p>    <p>Maples, 53, a former model and actress, is Trump’s second wife and the mother of his fourth child, Tiffany, 23.

All the better qualified, more sympathetic and empathic characters have been eliminated.

From the robed supreme court chief justice holding aloft Lincoln’s Bible for Trump to swear on to the gathering of former presidents, the entire purpose of an inauguration is to celebrate a mature democracy. As the White House is bequeathed to the popular choice, it’s intended to symbolise continuity and stability – a common destiny in a shared polity.</p> <p>Friday achieved the opposite. To watch Trump take the oath was to bear witness to democracy’s fragility.

As Donald Trump stepped forward to become America’s 45th president the cold shower that broke over Washington offered no end of metaphors. His address, however, was literal to a fault. There was no higher calling, no sense of a greater purpose, no florid imagery or impassioned idealism. This was as crude and unapologetic an appeal to nationalism as one might expect from a man incapable of rising to an occasion without first refracting it through his ego. It is said that presidents campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Trump campaigned in graffiti – the profane scrawls of a mindless vandal – and, if his inaugural address was anything to go by, may yet govern in tweets – the impulsive, abbreviated interventions of a narcissist. Were this a reality TV show, we would have switched off by now. All the better qualified, more sympathetic and empathic characters have been eliminated. The last man standing is a scheming, pathological misanthrope whose disrespect for the rules alone should have disqualified him. The producer would have been fired; the advertisers would have bolted. Nobody in their right mind would want anything to do with it. But there is a difference between reality TV and something surreal that you can watch on TV. From the robed supreme court chief justice holding aloft Lincoln’s Bible for Trump to swear on to the gathering of former presidents, the entire purpose of an inauguration is to celebrate a mature democracy. As the White House is bequeathed to the popular choice, it’s intended to symbolise continuity and stability – a common destiny in a shared polity. Friday achieved the opposite. To watch Trump take the oath was to bear witness to democracy’s fragility. It marked not simply the transfer of power from one leader to another but the erosion of the very values that give that power legitimacy. That frailty stems not from any question about whether Trump won the election but how he won it and what that victory portends. There is more to democracy than elections and more to elections than simply voting. Democratic traditions are underpinned by norms that he not only disregarded (on that score he would not be the first) but brazenly and gleefully violated – advocating violence at his rallies, haranguing the media, fuelling racial animus, religious exclusion and misogyny. As such, his inauguration represents an indictment of an entire political culture. It leaves condemned a Democratic party that could not defeat him, a Republican party that would not disown him, a mainstream media that failed to scrutinise him and a social media that spread his lies far faster than any scrutiny could travel. All were found wanting. Now all will be tested. This is no local problem. Those who take to the streets across the globe to demonstrate Trump’s presidency over the next few days would do well to stay there and resist his counterparts in their own backyards. Where this particular threat to democracy is concerned, America is by no means exceptional. In Washington, the moment was all the more disorienting because of what it replaced. Barack Obama’s approval ratings are higher now than they have been for some time, reminding us of the stratospheric expectations of that freezing January day when he first took office eight years ago. It’s as though his presence could never compete with his promise or his passing. To watch him accompany Trump through the process was to see the civility of pageantry triumph over the candour of politics. Several of those with front-row seats, from both parties, had concluded Trump was unfit for the office he now holds. “When making life or death or war or peace decisions,” Michelle Obama said six weeks before election day, “a president just can’t pop off or lash out irrationally … If a candidate traffics in fear and lies on the campaign trail … well that is the kind of president they will be.” That is the president who was sworn in on Friday.

The election of Donald Trump, who, labelling climate change a “hoax” created by China, has reversed the conspiracy, casts a dark shadow on the prospect of future international climate cooperation. But for China, now could be a moment of opportunity. Since the catastrophic Copenhagen failure in 2009, China has anchored climate actions at the core of its political agenda. There are three main reasons for this, and over the next four years, they will be the drivers that will propel China’s climate action forward regardless of the political situation in the US. First, the calculus of cost and benefit has shifted. For a long time, environmental protection was positioned on the opposite side of economic prosperity – the pursuit of one could only sacrifice the other. In China, this binary has fallen apart, as the enormous health impacts of air pollution have galvanised both political and public opinion against polluting industry, and as the booming clean energy industry shows the possibility to make both environmentally and economically sound investments. Second, China feels an increased – and increasing – sense of global responsibility, as displayed in phrase after phrase of Xi Jinping’s speeches in Davos and Geneva this week.

China is slowly but surely re-defining its international responsibilities and shifting to a more active and cooperation oriented climate diplomacy.

US-China cooperation on climate in the Obama era helped to elevate climate change to the very top of the Chinese leadership’s agenda. This has ensured the unprecedented direct engagement of the Chinese leaders for multiple years, and not only familiarised them with the technicality and politics of climate change, but also allowed them to see the strategic value it can generate.

What China urgently needs now is a comprehensive strategy that sets climate change as a diplomatic priority. For the past years, China’s policy circle primarily considered climate change through the lens of managing US-China relations and as an issue subordinate to the most important bilateral relationship in the world. As the political winds shift in Washington, climate change now deserves an independent strategy that takes into account but is not dependent on the US-China relationship. Chinese leaders should be confident in such an approach and not underestimate the country’s potential for global leadership. The establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road initiative both demonstrate that, when the issue is given political priority, China is not only able to participate in international diplomacy, but can also actively lead. None of these is to say China should step in for the US. Climate change is a crisis larger than any single country. And it is neither feasible nor fair to expect other countries to fill the hole left by the US. But for China, if what it takes to move from a climate villain to a reluctant leader is the short five years of the first half of this decade, it is not completely unreasonable to expect the country to become a true leader by the end of this decade. As Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Xi might well establish one of his own.

In an interview with the Guardian, the veteran novelist and memoirist revealed he is interested in becoming the group’s president in 2018. The organisation, one of many around the world campaigning for the rights of writers, is currently led by author Andrew Solomon. Auster, the Brooklyn-based writer of The New York Trilogy, said the position had “been offered to me again and again over the years” but the election of Trump had persuaded him to actively pursue the role. The news came as it was reported that the new US administration plans to hack away arts and humanities funding by abolishing the national endowments for the arts (NEA) and humanities (NEH), both of which have annual budgets of just under $150m (£120m). The NEA has funded the early careers of more than 60 major literary award winners, including Jonathan Franzen and Annie Proulx. The money saved would amount to less than 0.000075% of the annual federal budget of $3.9tn, according to the congressional budget office. A former vice president and secretary of PEN America, Auster admitted that until now, he had not wanted to take on the full burden of the organisation’s leadership, but that he doubted he could live with himself if he didn’t pursue the role during Trump’s presidency. Promising to speak often if he received the position, Auster, a significant voice in the US books world for the last 30 years, said he had been shocked at the result of the election in November. “I feel utterly astonished that we could have come to this. I find his election the most appalling thing I’ve seen in politics in my life,” he explained, in an interview to mark publication of his latest novel, 4321, a 900-page opus that he regards as the most significant book of his career. Recent revelations about Russian hackers’ interference in the US election, Auster said, were “almost like a declaration of war, without bullets” and had galvanised him to take a stand. Though the new novel covers the turbulent 1960s, including the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war, Auster said: “Tumultuous as those times were, they weren’t as depressing as what’s going on today.” He added: “It seems as though America has always been split between the people who believe in the individual above everything else, and those people who believe we’re responsible for one another.” His comments followed reports that the incoming Trump administration plans to abolish the NEA and NEH.

In written responses to Wyden, Pompeo backed away from his proposed hoard of metadata, repeatedly saying, “My op-ed was designed to provide general thoughts on the types of information that may be helpful in protecting the country. I did not propose a full legislative framework that would govern exact access to such information, the restrictions on searches and dissemination, or retention time frames.” Additionally, Pompeo appeared to give a contradictory answer about the propriety of a foreign government providing the CIA with communications concerning Americans against whom there were no warrants. Pompeo told Wyden at the hearing: “The same set of rules that surround the information if it were collected by the US government apply to information that becomes available as – as a result of collection from non-US sources, as well.” But in correspondence with the committee, Pompeo wrote that it was “appropriate” for the CIA to receive such intelligence on Americans “without the same requirements that would apply if the CIA itself were to collect the information”. Pompeo also repeatedly pledged to follow laws currently banning torture and bulk domestic phone records collection. But some Democrats worry that a justice department under Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, would provide legal reinterpretations to reconcile both practices within current statutory prohibitions, similar to its behavior during the Bush administration.",3547,Spencer Ackerman in New York,NA,NA,NA,"<a href=""profile/spencerackerman"">Spencer Ackerman</a> in New York",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Other one-time political heavyweights who couldn’t keep away included David Cameron, widely criticised this week for holding the EU referendum, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Climate change fears abound Campaigners are worried that the years of slow progress made on climate change are going to melt away once Trump is in the White House. Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg spoke for many when she warned that Trump might simply not implement the Paris agreement, to keep global warming “well below” 2C. Activists at Davos told us they were keeping a very close eye on the Trump administration, fearing it will alter or make unavailable vital climate change data. China is flexing its muscles At Davos you know a speaker is a real draw if they manage to fill both the cavernous conference hall and also the overspill room.

A narcissist whose misogyny borders on psychopathy – a man accused by dozens of women of sexual misconduct – is now leading our nation. With a cabinet chock-full of Bond villains and neophytes, and a Twitter feed spilling over with vile, Trump is throwing us into a dark and uncertain time. For women, especially, the future seems bleak – but we can at least take it on and find ways to cope together. So I hope you’ll join me in the next weeks, months, years (yikes), in following what’s happening with feminism and sexism through The Week in Patriarchy. I’m sure we’ll have plenty to talk about. Glass Half Full Let’s choose to be optimists, at least for a little while. Thousands of women are expected to descend upon Washington tomorrow in what might be the biggest march in American history. Wearing “pussy hats” (my mother-in-law tells me stores in her California town are out of pink yarn) and bearing signs, women might just get a much-needed catharsis this weekend. I’ll be there as well, but what I really hope is that we can turn this action into lasting change. What I’m RTing Who I’m Reading Jamilah Lemieux at ColorLines on why she won’t be marching on DC tomorrow; Buzz Feed on the queer dance party that was thrown in protest in front of Mike Pence’s house.

He has 20 runs in the form book already, including 13 starts over fences and a close second in one of France’s major Grade One races last time out. He is also a striking chestnut, with a white blaze on his face.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/thistlecrack-colin-tizzard-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing"">Thistlecrack will spearhead Colin Tizzard team in Cheltenham Gold Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he remains an unknown quantity for British punters, who have shown considerable faith in Tizzard’s judgment with a steady swell of support for Alary throughout the week before Saturday’s Peter Marsh Chase.</p> <p>The seven-year-old, who was bought late last year to run in the green, yellow and red colours of Alan Potts, will carry top weight in the limited handicap and race off an official rating of 162. Tizzard’s Native River, the Welsh National winner and second-favourite for the Gold Cup, has a mark of 168, so victory for Alary would make him <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/thistlecrack-colin-tizzard-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing"" title="""">a very credible fifth member of the stable’s Gold Cup team, alongside Thistlecrack, Cue Card,Native River and longshot Theatre Guide</a>.</p> <p>“He was bought as a very good horse and he’s done everything we could have asked of him at home,” Joe Tizzard, the trainer’s son and assistant, said on Friday. “He’s settled in well, he’s got used to our uphill gallop and we’re very excited about running him. He was second, beaten half a length, on his last run, in the French equivalent of the King George Chase, and the horse that beat him is apparently the top-rated horse in France.</p> <p>“Before we bought him, we watched videos of him and I went over and sat on him, and we phoned Phil Smith [the British Horseracing Authority’s senior handicapper] and asked him what sort of mark he would get, and whether he would be competitive in a Gold Cup on what he knew about the form. He said that he would be, so as long as he takes to the English style of racing, he should be all right.”</p> <p>Big-money buys in France have not been the Tizzards’ way until now. The stable’s rise towards its current status as the major challenger to Paul Nicholls in the championship has been achieved by buying young powerfully built jumping types, bought as a result of Colin Tizzard’s uncanny eye for a potential champion like Cue Card.</p> <p>The recent arrival of Potts on Tizzard’s list of owners, however, means that the trainer now has a cheque book to match those wielded by National Hunt’s biggest players. “Long-term, most of our luck has been through the stores route, but we haven’t had the backing of a Mr Potts to go and buy this sort of horse,” Joe Tizzard said. “This was a different situation, Mr Potts wanted a Cheltenham Festival horse, a Gold Cup horse, and this horse came on the market so we went and tried him, and got him. We don’t mind how we get hold of them, so long as we do.</p> <p>“We were lucky until he came along to have the likes of Mrs [Jean] Bishop [the owner of Cue Card] and Brocade Racing [the syndicate that owns Native River]. They were our biggest-spending owners and we had a really good season last year, but it’s the next step to have Mr Potts arrive with 15 horses, and then go out and invest in three more. It’s massive for our yard and takes us up to another level, hence the sort of season we’ve been having.”</p> <p>The Tizzard yard is still about £200,000 behind Paul Nicholls in the trainers’ championship, and the 7-2 second favourite for the title, though with the perennial champion generally quiet in January, Saturday offers a chance to make more ground.</p> <p>“We perhaps haven’t got the numbers they have, but we’ve certainly got the good horses to be competitive on a Saturday at the moment,” Tizzard said “It’s something we’d love to have a good crack at, and we probably won’t be in this position every year. We’re spoilt with the horses we’ve got at the moment, but none of them last forever so we need people to reinvest in the younger horses, so that in three or four years’ time we’ve still got horses that are potentially in the Gold Cup.</p> <p>“I think the hardest part nowadays is buying the horses, and finding the good horses at the best time to buy them. Everybody can get them fit and run them in the right races, it’s getting lucky and getting hold of the best horses, like Cue Card, Thistlecrack and Native River.

Alary is not a dark horse, in any sense of the words. He has 20 runs in the form book already, including 13 starts over fences and a close second in one of France’s major Grade One races last time out. He is also a striking chestnut, with a white blaze on his face. But he remains an unknown quantity for British punters, who have shown considerable faith in Tizzard’s judgment with a steady swell of support for Alary throughout the week before Saturday’s Peter Marsh Chase. The seven-year-old, who was bought late last year to run in the green, yellow and red colours of Alan Potts, will carry top weight in the limited handicap and race off an official rating of 162. Tizzard’s Native River, the Welsh National winner and second-favourite for the Gold Cup, has a mark of 168, so victory for Alary would make him a very credible fifth member of the stable’s Gold Cup team, alongside Thistlecrack, Cue Card,Native River and longshot Theatre Guide. “He was bought as a very good horse and he’s done everything we could have asked of him at home,” Joe Tizzard, the trainer’s son and assistant, said on Friday. “He’s settled in well, he’s got used to our uphill gallop and we’re very excited about running him. He was second, beaten half a length, on his last run, in the French equivalent of the King George Chase, and the horse that beat him is apparently the top-rated horse in France. “Before we bought him, we watched videos of him and I went over and sat on him, and we phoned Phil Smith [the British Horseracing Authority’s senior handicapper] and asked him what sort of mark he would get, and whether he would be competitive in a Gold Cup on what he knew about the form. He said that he would be, so as long as he takes to the English style of racing, he should be all right.” Big-money buys in France have not been the Tizzards’ way until now. The stable’s rise towards its current status as the major challenger to Paul Nicholls in the championship has been achieved by buying young powerfully built jumping types, bought as a result of Colin Tizzard’s uncanny eye for a potential champion like Cue Card. The recent arrival of Potts on Tizzard’s list of owners, however, means that the trainer now has a cheque book to match those wielded by National Hunt’s biggest players. “Long-term, most of our luck has been through the stores route, but we haven’t had the backing of a Mr Potts to go and buy this sort of horse,” Joe Tizzard said. “This was a different situation, Mr Potts wanted a Cheltenham Festival horse, a Gold Cup horse, and this horse came on the market so we went and tried him, and got him. We don’t mind how we get hold of them, so long as we do. “We were lucky until he came along to have the likes of Mrs [Jean] Bishop [the owner of Cue Card] and Brocade Racing [the syndicate that owns Native River]. They were our biggest-spending owners and we had a really good season last year, but it’s the next step to have Mr Potts arrive with 15 horses, and then go out and invest in three more. It’s massive for our yard and takes us up to another level, hence the sort of season we’ve been having.” The Tizzard yard is still about £200,000 behind Paul Nicholls in the trainers’ championship, and the 7-2 second favourite for the title, though with the perennial champion generally quiet in January, Saturday offers a chance to make more ground. “We perhaps haven’t got the numbers they have, but we’ve certainly got the good horses to be competitive on a Saturday at the moment,” Tizzard said “It’s something we’d love to have a good crack at, and we probably won’t be in this position every year. We’re spoilt with the horses we’ve got at the moment, but none of them last forever so we need people to reinvest in the younger horses, so that in three or four years’ time we’ve still got horses that are potentially in the Gold Cup. “I think the hardest part nowadays is buying the horses, and finding the good horses at the best time to buy them. Everybody can get them fit and run them in the right races, it’s getting lucky and getting hold of the best horses, like Cue Card, Thistlecrack and Native River. You’ve got to find them at the right time.” The prospects for Ascot’s meeting on Saturday, which is due to feature the Grade One Clarence House Chase, appear bleak after Chris Stickels, the track’s clerk of the course, called a 6.30am inspection and conceded: “We are up against it, I’m afraid.” Parts of the track are frozen and the current forecast of freezing temperatures again on Friday night will need to be significantly askew if the meeting is to survive. “In my view, we wouldn’t have raced today,” Stickels said. “It’s not so much because of the frost overnight, but the accumulation of a few nights of frost. “The forecast is for it get down to -3C tonight and then it’s not due to get up above 3C or 4C on Saturday with an easterly wind and possible freezing fog during the morning.

The disconnect is glaring but perhaps dimmed in the eyes of some readers because Australian politicians have been dissembling on climate change for decades, pretending it will be possible to do what we must without any impact on our position as the world’s largest coal exporter or our domestic reliance on brown coal-fired power, or without incurring any costs. The Coalition government – which boasts as one of its proudest achievements the repeal of the former government’s emissions trading scheme – has a particular need for doublespeak. Having run two election campaigns on the pledge of “axing the tax” with hyperbolic assertions that it would strangle the economy and impoverish households, it found it convenient to claim the discovery of the climate policy equivalent of a free lunch. The Coalition has never resolved the bitter internal divisions with conservative climate doubters that saw Malcolm Turnbull overthrown as leader in 2009 owing to his support for carbon pricing, to be replaced by Tony Abbott, who had declared the settled science of climate change to be “crap” and believed coal was “good for humanity”. In September 2015 Turnbull overthrew Abbott but, since then, climate change has barely rated a mention and the new prime minister has surprised many by apparently falling into line with the mineral industry’s argument that our coal exports are really doing the world a big favour. Trump’s victory has emboldened the doubters – the resources minister, Matt Canavan, for example, enthused that “Donald Trump is good for fossil fuels, good for steel and good for Australia”. But it has also coincided with more conflicting responses from the government. Less than a day after the US election, the Turnbull government ratified the Paris agreement – the same agreement the new US president has vowed to “tear up” and that calls for zero net emissions by the second half of the century – describing it was a “watershed … that has galvanised global action”. But then it promptly abandoned a domestic policy idea that represented its last credible chance of meeting its promised targets or galvanising any real action here. With the world recording its third year in a row of record temperatures and the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, any objective assessment would suggest the time for prevarication and obfuscation is long since past. We’ll soon see. On 1 February, in his first major speech for the year, Turnbull will stand before the National Press Club to explain his policy on energy and the greenhouse gases it produces. Experts from business, industry and the environment movement are wondering what he can possibly say. For years the former environment minister had privately reassured stakeholders that a 2017 review would quietly morph the Direct Action policy into a so-called emissions intensity trading scheme and business and environment groups alike were clinging to those promises as the last hope for a credible climate policy and an end to the investment drought caused by years of mindless “climate wars” and policy uncertainty. But late last year, despite advice that such a scheme would lead to lower household power prices, despite having bipartisan support and just hours after the current environment minister said the review would look at it, the government ruled it out. Turnbull will announce new vehicle emissions standards and a new energy efficiency scheme. He and his office are looking at “technological solutions” – bright new ideas in solar thermal, or battery or carbon storage technology that might fill the policy void. But all those technologies need government policies to provide investors with incentives and certainty, and without actually confronting the climate doubters no one can imagine what that policy might be. Turnbull will also reassure voters, who repeatedly tell pollsters they are worried about global warming, that Australia will “meet and beat” its international targets, as it has in the past. But again complexity hides the underwhelming truth. Australia got not one but two special deals in the original Kyoto protocol – an allowance to increase its emissions in absolute terms – unlike almost all other developed countries, on account of our reliance on fossil fuels – and another special deal so particular to our circumstances it was called “the Australia clause”. It allowed the inclusion of land-use changes in emission calculations in a way that meant restrictions that had already been imposed on large-scale land clearing – especially in Queensland – allowed Australia to rest assured it had achieved its new target before it even signed up to it. The deal was so good we did “meet and beat” the target and, unlike almost all other developed countries, we are using that overshoot to help us also meet our very low 2020 target. But now state governments are overturning land-clearing restrictions and the federal government is arguing that states should abandon their regional renewable energy targets, which were only ever necessary because the federal scheme is effectively winding down. In short, we have done very little and we have no effective federal policies to shift to a low emissions economy, and everyone knows it. Trump gives the Australian sceptics the chance to run the same old arguments – if the US does nothing, then why should we? His victory has increased the prospect that some of them could split to form a new conservative party. The energy market remains so complex that all kinds of wild claims can be made to justify a do-nothing end. And international climate negotiations remain so byzantine that countries can claim hero status while doing very little.

Both teams are still on course for the last 16, though the Ivory Coast in particular are cutting it a bit fine. Thanks for your company; night! Peep peep! 90+2 min Kalou has a brilliant goal disallowed for offside! It was the right decision, just about. It was also an outstanding volley from Kalou to adroitly convert a long, curling free-kick from a deep position on the right. 90+1 min There will be three added minutes. 90 min Another corner to the Ivory Coast on the right. Kessie’s low outswinger is flicked imaginatively behind his standing leg by Aurier at the near post, and Matampi makes a comfortable save. 89 min Zaha skips down the right and drags a low cross to Kalou, whose first-time shot is deflected behind for a corner. Kessie’s corner is cleared. 87 min What a chance for Aurier! Kessie’s inswinging corner from the left found him unmarked at the near post, but he mistimed his header across goal and Zaha couldn’t force it in. Aurier should have scored. 86 min The tireless Kessie breaks down the left to win a corner for the Ivory Coast. The pressure is relentless. 84 min Another long-range blast from Serey Die is blocked. DR Congo look absolutely shattered now; they don’t even have the energy to try to counter-attack. 82 min The Ivory Coast get a free-kick 30 yards out. Kalou hits a feeble effort a few yards wide. 79 min Mubele earns DR Congo a breather with a comical dive. During the break in play, Jonathan Bolingi replaces the superb Kabananga. 77 min Zaha’s mishit cross from the left sneaks over Matampi and just clears the crossbar. 77 min An Ivory Coast substitution: Salomon Kalou replaces the excellent Gradel. 76 min DR Congo are starting to look tired, with an Ivory Coast winner looking increasingly likely. 73 min Gradel’s set-pieces have caused trouble all day, and this time he hits a dipping right-wing corner that flashes across the box off the head of Aurier. 72 min A double substitution for DR Congo: Youssouf Mulumbu and Remi Mulumba replace Maghoma and Ikoko. Mulumba plays for Ajaccio, once the club of Cyrille Makanaky and Carlos Kaiser. 69 min A draw would still leave Ivory Coast in a bit of trouble, depending on the result tonight, but one point is better than none. Obviously. It might have been 3-1; instead it’s 2-2. The captain Serey Die surges forward from midfield before hitting a 20-yard shot that takes a big deflection off Tisserand and wrongfoots the keeper Matampi. 66 min Another chance for Ivory Coast! Ikoko played a curling pass down the right towards Mubele that was hopelessly misread by Kanon. That allowed Mubele to scoot into the area on the right. He had Mbokani waiting for a tap-in at the far post, but the ball took a nasty bounce and Mubele sliced his cross into the hands of Gbohouo. 65 min The first yellow card of the match goes to Franck Kessie for a foul on Mbemba. 61 min The influential Gradel plays a good square pass to find Doukoure in space 30 yards from goal. He gets it out of his feet and hits a deflected low shot that is palmed away by the diving Matampi. 55 min Mubele almost makes it 3-1 with a sensational solo goal. He retrieved a nothing ball on the right before turning infield and muscling past Kanon and Gradel. That took him into the box, where he swerved away from Kessie and struck a rising drive from a narrow angle that rippled the side netting. 52 min DR Congo are content to sit deep and counter-attack, an approach that has worked pretty well so far. The Ivory Coast have created very little in open play. 48 min What a chance for the substitute Deli! Gradel curled in a superb free-kick from the right; Deli got to it first, in plenty of space 10 yards from goal, and flicked a downward header just wide of the far post. He should probably have scored. 48 min You have to work hard to get booked in this match. Kabananga does his best with a cynical tug on Zaha, but the referee keeps his yellow card untouched. 46 min DR Congo begin the second half, kicking from right to left. Ivory Coast have made a half-time substitution, with Simon Deli on for Adama Traore. That was lots of fun, for neutrals and DR Congo fans anyway. Ivory Coast are 45 minutes away from a major problem. See you soon for the second half. 45 min A superb bit of sweeper-keeping from Gbohouo, who charges 35 yards from his goal to clear a dangerous through ball towards Kabananga. 42 min Gradel is clattered by Ikoko, who might have been booked for that. Ivory Coast have been much better in the second half of this first half. They will hope to buOH MY EFFING LORD DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT. 41 min Aurier curls a 25-yard free-kick straight at Matampi. It was well struck but too straight. 40 min Zaha surges at Issama, who produces an excellent sliding tackle. He has defended very well. 39 min If Ivory Coast lose today they wouldn’t be out of the competition, but it would leave them in considerable trouble - especially if Togo beat Morocco tonight. 35 min This has turned into a terrific game. Ivory Coast are in Big Ron’s wide awake club now, attacking with an urgency that borders on desperation. 33 min “I don’t want to distract you from the game,” says Charles Antaki, “but you should know that in a dramatic development, Donald Trump has renounced the office of president in favour of Elvis Presley, who has emerged from a space vehicle that has just landed in front of the White House.” Next you’ll be telling me Leicester won the Premier League last year. 30 min Gradel’s deep cross drops over the head of Issama to Zaha, who is slightly unsighted and miscontrols the ball out of play. That was an opportunity for the Ivory Coast. DR Congo are back in front! Not even Quasimodo predicted this! Tisserand starts the move by pinging a flat crossfield ball to Mubele on the right, a really superb pass. He runs at Traore before teasing a delightful cross beyond the far post, where Kabananga is criminally unmarked and rises to head firmly past Gbohouo. 27 min “Out of curiosity,” says Prancing Hog, “are you watching this game live from Stade d’Oyem?” I wish, Prancing, I wish. This is an excellent spell for the Ivory Coast, who have come to life after an abysmal start - and now they are level! Gradel curls a left-wing corner towards the near post, where Bony rises emphatically to power a header across goal and into the net. 24 min Gradel’s cross is dropped by Matampi at the feet of Bony, but he doesn’t react quickly enough and Matampi claims it at the second attempt. 22 min Bony misses a good chance to make it 1-1. Aurier, lurking near the halfway line on the right, curled a superb high pass over the defence to put Bony clear on goal. He had to take it first time just inside the box, and tried to lob his header over the keeper Matampi. He got the length right but not the line, and it drifted wide of the near post. 22 min There is something uniquely beautiful about goals like Kebano’s, half-volleys that barely leave the floor as they whistle past the keeper. Here’s the masterpiece of the genre: 21 min “You’re not alone, Rob,” says TM Abdelhamid. “This match is of particular interest here as Egypt might very well play either of the two teams should the Pharaohs play their next couple of games way better than they did their opener against Mali. Theoretically this is the Elephants’ game, but the Leopards are not going to let go of their initial group lead that easily.” 19 min As good as DR Congo have been, Ivory Coast look like they couldn’t give a flying one! The lack of urgency and competence is almost startling. 18 min Some nice footwork from the lively Mubele, who is booted up in the air by Doukoure for his impudence. That might have been a yellow card. 17 min “This game promises to be much better than Trump’s swearing in,” says Jamie Hitchen. “My money is on DRC to win the tournament and I expect them to win today. Decent players in most positions, plenty of goals in the team (they scored a lot of goals in qualifying for Afcon 2017) and they are world-ranked 49th.” They have been excellent so far - hungry, organised and full of menace on the counter-attack. 14 min DR Congo have been much the better side so far. Ivory Coast seem to be suffering from the same inertia that was evident in their first game. That really was a superb goal. A longish throw from the left was well controlled by Kabananga in the box. He flicked the ball back to Kebano, who arrived late in the box and then, as it bounced, belted it across Gbohouo and into the far corner. What a strike! Neeskens Kebano of Fulham scorches a half-volley into the far corner to give DR Congo the lead! 9 min Mubele wins the first corner of the match with a decisive run down the left. The DR Congo corner is a poor one and volleyed away by Bony. 8 min “Here with you mate!” writes my good friend Prancing Hog. “What’s your prediction for the game? The Elephants’ forward line should be too good to take them thru. 2-0 is how I predict this match going.” I think Congo might sneak this 1-0. But, strictly between us, I’ve not a clue what I’m talking about. 7 min Zaha overhits a cross straight out of play. He was lively in the first game, when he was surprisingly substituted, and you can already see that he is trying to make something happen. 6 min It’s been a really sleepy start to the game, as it was when the Ivory Coast drew their opening match with Togo. Whatever happened to the fast start? 3 min DR Congo have started confidently and with most of the possession, albeit all in non-dangerous areas. 1 min Peep peep! The Ivory Coast kick off from right to left. They are in orange and green; DR Congo are wearing white. Anyone out there? Come on, this has got to be more uplifting than the Trump liveblog. Ivory Coast (4-3-3) Gbohouo; Aurier, Kanon, Bailly, Traore; Doukoure, Kessie, Serey Die; Zaha, Bony, Gradel. DR Congo (4-2-3-1) Matampi; Bope, Issama, Ikoko, Tisserand; Maghoma, Mbemba; Kabananga, Kebano, Mubele; Mbokani. Hello. You spend years building up to something and it’s over in a trice.

In 1990, the American lawyer and author Mike Godwin <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/29/mike-godwin-nazi-analogies-meme-update"" title="""">proposed a natural law</a> of the behaviour of Usenet newsgroup conversations: “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.” In short, the more you talk online, the more likely you’ll be nasty; talk long enough, and it’s a certainty. (Godwin’s law can easily be observed today on newspapers’ online comment threads.)</p> <p>A little later, the American academic <a href=""http://www-usr.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/suler.html"" title="""">John Suler</a> was studying the behaviour of participants in early online chat rooms. He found that participants tended to be more aggressive and angry online than off. This was, he said, because when we’re protected by a screen, the usual social restrictions, responsibilities and norms don’t apply. We don’t know or see the people we’re speaking to, and they don’t know or see us. And because it all takes place in what feels like an alternate reality, we do things we wouldn’t in real life. Suler called this the <a href=""http://users.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/disinhibit.html"" title="""">“online disinhibition effect”</a>.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The term 'snowflake' is a very easy way to dismiss opponents’ concerns</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back then, no one really listened to any of this because most of us weren’t online. But that’s all changed. People knowingly talk about “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers” over the dinner table. Liberals complain that Trump supporters are stuck in a fake news filter bubble, while Conservatives mock the liberals stuck in their elite echo chamber.</p> <p>This understanding is all at least partly true, but it involves always pinning the blame on someone else. However, communication is a two-way street. True, social media makes us more impulsive, less physically connected to the people we insult, and more likely to be rude. But it also affords the chance to get offended; 15 minutes on Facebook and you can rile yourself up nicely. If you want it, social media offers endless excuses to be outraged and angry.</p> <p>And why not? Being offended and outraged by someone else’s 140 characters is a perfectly pleasant sensation. I suspect a lot of people are quietly happy when they read something online they dislike. It provides a warm feeling of righteous indignation, and the chance to attack your enemies for being so damn ignorant and narrow-minded. In so doing you can express your own, morally superior, view. Said outrage can be put to political use.</p> <p>Which leads me to Conservative MP Michael Gove. It is in fact of little relevance whether <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/18/boris-johnson-world-war-two-punishment-beatings-brexit-francois-hollande"" title="""">Boris Johnson did or did not</a> compare François Hollande to a Nazi guard earlier this week. You can’t blame “online disinhibition” for it: Johnson said this offline, at a speech in India. Back in 2002 he <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/23/london.race"" title="""">described black people as “piccaninnies” in a column</a>; in 2006 Papua New Guineans were<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/09/uk.conservatives"" title=""""> cannibals and chief killers</a>. Johnson is unique in that he appears to have online disinhibition even when he is not online.</p> <p>What is relevant, though, is what followed this week: waves of pointless and escalating outrage. Some people online were upset by Johnson’s remark. They thought it was crass.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/821770347758419968"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">People &quot;offended&quot; by The Foreign Secretary&#39;s comments today are humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes-it&#39;s a witty metaphor <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/getalife?src=hash"">#getalife</a></p>&mdash; Michael Gove (@michaelgove) <a href=""https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/821770347758419968"">January 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Jackpot! Gove was upset that some people online were upset. He <a href=""https://twitter.com/michaelgove/status/821770347758419968"" title="""">tweeted</a>: “People ‘offended’ by the foreign secretary’s comments today are humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes – it’s a witty metaphor #getalife”.</p> <p>Snowflake has become the shorthand rightwing – or libertarian – derogatory term for leftwing people who are easily offended. It’s a very easy way to dismiss opponents’ concerns. People who thought the foreign secretary might consider watching his words during delicate EU negotiations are thin-skinned idiots. Unlike Gove, who is a muscular liberal, an arch defender of free speech.</p> <p>But the snowflakes hit back. Gove was being intentionally and unnecessarily divisive. They were upset that Gove was upset that some people were upset. And on and on down the chain went the upset. Like the Capulets and Montagues, the original point of disagreement was swiftly forgotten. The feud fed itself, and both sides walked away feeling slightly more angry than when they started.</p> <p>This is why social media is making the business of politics nastier. Almost every politician is online. They are subject to the same feelings of mild outrage and anger as we all are. In a world of social media spats and Twitter storms, your opponents can’t simply hold a principled, different opinion. They must be bad. They must be incoherent babblers, sinister Machiavellians, politically correct elites, or hoodwinked buffoons. And they’re everywhere, these people! This makes compromise more difficult, since compromise depends on accepting that the people you disagree with hold their principled opinions in good faith. And without compromise, there is no politics. But it’s not “them” – those idiots on Twitter and Facebook – who are the problem. It’s also “us”, who secretly enjoy finding them, and sharing our outrage and moral rectitude with the world.</p>",858,2017-01-20T12:44:10Z,false,false,2019-07-10T09:44:28Z,NA,UK,theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/p/5mcf3,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/0e31beeae46127d250f8c975cdae798f589aadca/357_46_3692_2216/500.jpg,false,en,true,"There’s a new consensus about what social media is doing to public life: it’s making us meaner to each other.

We don’t know or see the people we’re speaking to, and they don’t know or see us. And because it all takes place in what feels like an alternate reality, we do things we wouldn’t in real life. Suler called this the “online disinhibition effect”. Back then, no one really listened to any of this because most of us weren’t online. But that’s all changed. People knowingly talk about “filter bubbles” and “echo chambers” over the dinner table. Liberals complain that Trump supporters are stuck in a fake news filter bubble, while Conservatives mock the liberals stuck in their elite echo chamber. This understanding is all at least partly true, but it involves always pinning the blame on someone else. However, communication is a two-way street. True, social media makes us more impulsive, less physically connected to the people we insult, and more likely to be rude. But it also affords the chance to get offended; 15 minutes on Facebook and you can rile yourself up nicely. If you want it, social media offers endless excuses to be outraged and angry. And why not? Being offended and outraged by someone else’s 140 characters is a perfectly pleasant sensation. I suspect a lot of people are quietly happy when they read something online they dislike. It provides a warm feeling of righteous indignation, and the chance to attack your enemies for being so damn ignorant and narrow-minded. In so doing you can express your own, morally superior, view. Said outrage can be put to political use. Which leads me to Conservative MP Michael Gove. It is in fact of little relevance whether Boris Johnson did or did not compare François Hollande to a Nazi guard earlier this week. You can’t blame “online disinhibition” for it: Johnson said this offline, at a speech in India. Back in 2002 he described black people as “piccaninnies” in a column; in 2006 Papua New Guineans were cannibals and chief killers. Johnson is unique in that he appears to have online disinhibition even when he is not online. What is relevant, though, is what followed this week: waves of pointless and escalating outrage. Some people online were upset by Johnson’s remark. They thought it was crass. Jackpot! Gove was upset that some people online were upset. He tweeted: “People ‘offended’ by the foreign secretary’s comments today are humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes – it’s a witty metaphor #getalife”. Snowflake has become the shorthand rightwing – or libertarian – derogatory term for leftwing people who are easily offended. It’s a very easy way to dismiss opponents’ concerns. People who thought the foreign secretary might consider watching his words during delicate EU negotiations are thin-skinned idiots. Unlike Gove, who is a muscular liberal, an arch defender of free speech. But the snowflakes hit back. Gove was being intentionally and unnecessarily divisive. They were upset that Gove was upset that some people were upset. And on and on down the chain went the upset. Like the Capulets and Montagues, the original point of disagreement was swiftly forgotten. The feud fed itself, and both sides walked away feeling slightly more angry than when they started. This is why social media is making the business of politics nastier. Almost every politician is online. They are subject to the same feelings of mild outrage and anger as we all are. In a world of social media spats and Twitter storms, your opponents can’t simply hold a principled, different opinion. They must be bad. They must be incoherent babblers, sinister Machiavellians, politically correct elites, or hoodwinked buffoons. And they’re everywhere, these people! This makes compromise more difficult, since compromise depends on accepting that the people you disagree with hold their principled opinions in good faith. And without compromise, there is no politics. But it’s not “them” – those idiots on Twitter and Facebook – who are the problem. It’s also “us”, who secretly enjoy finding them, and sharing our outrage and moral rectitude with the world.",5286,Jamie Bartlett,2017-01-20T17:30:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/jamiebartlett"">Jamie Bartlett</a>",NA,2017-01-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Officials said that after landing at MacArthur airport on Long Island, he was driven in a 13-vehicle motorcade to the metropolitan correction center in Manhattan, before being moved to Brooklyn at 7am on Friday.

Officials also would not comment on where Guzmán would be detained and on extra precautions being taken to guard the capo, who twice absconded from high-security prisons in Mexico – most recently through a sophisticated underground passageway which led from his cell bathroom. Melendez said to laughter that “no tunnel will be built leading to his bathroom”. “What occurred in other countries will not occur here,” said Capers. Following his second escape in 2015, Guzmán was recaptured in a seedy motel in the city of Los Mochis after federal agents trailed the actor Sean Penn to a clandestine meeting with the fugitive kingpin. A 56-page memo filed to court by US authorities on Friday said that prosecutors plan to use at trial “a large coterie of cooperating witnesses”, including dozens of people who claim to have had face-to-face dealings with Guzmán and US-based drug distributors who were supplied by the Sinaloa cartel. One witness is expected to testify about Guzmán’s use of assassins against his rivals, “including his use of a house specially outfitted for murdering victims”, the court filing said. “The house had plastic sheets over the walls to catch spouting blood and a drain in the floor to facilitate the draining of blood.” Other witnesses are said to be prepared to testify about “specific murders carried out under Guzmán’s orders” including the killing of the cocaine trafficker Julio Beltrán, as well as Guzmán’s payment of bribes to Mexican politicians and law enforcement officials. Physical evidence, such as ledgers from Colombian drug cartel bosses detailing agreements with Guzmán, would also be used against him, according to the memo, along with intercepted electronic surveillance of Guzmán and “numerous physical surveillances” in the US and other countries. Authorities requested that Guzmán be detained pending his trial due to the severity of the allegations against him, the threat he posed to the public, and the risk that he would flee the country. Guzmán faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted. Prosecutors said in the indictment that the US also intends to seek the forfeiture of at least $14bn in money and property from Guzmán. Capers confirmed that in order to extradite Guzmán, Mexico had required that there was no possibility he would face the death penalty. The Guardian disclosed last year that the US had quietly removed specific murder charges against Guzmán from his charge sheet. A grand jury indictment first filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the outgoing US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, was the district’s top federal prosecutor, had charged Guzmán and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels.",5843,Jon Swaine in New York,2017-01-23T17:15:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/jon-swaine"">Jon Swaine</a> in New York",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is hard to imagine two more contrasting English dramatists. Rattigan wrote elegant dramas of the English upper classes, including The Deep Blue Sea and The Winslow Boy, that have become standards of the West End and National Theatre. Barker writes jagged epics that reimagine history, geography and language: The Castle is a version of the Crusades, while <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/10/victory-arcola-london-review"">Victory</a> fictionalises the English civil war. Although Barker is feted in France – one production there has been running for two years – he has only once been performed at the National: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/05/scenes-from-an-execution-review"">Scenes from an Execution</a>, about a 16th-century Italian painter commissioned to glorify a war victory, was revived there five years ago.<br></p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/20/in-the-depths-of-dead-love-review-howard-barker-print-room-coronet-london"">In the Depths of Dead Love review – stultifying all-white Chinese fable</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Any chance of Barker’s wall ever sporting the sort of blue plaque that marks Rattigan’s former residence has receded further with the latest controversy. In the past, the playwright has tended to offend the political right: the Telegraph railed against the repeated c-words in Victory, while one British theatre director is reputed to have hurled another Barker play, The Europeans, at his office wall, condemning it as simplistically leftwing.</p> <p> The writer’s latest foes, though, are liberals. Many in the theatre world have publicly criticised the casting of white British actors in all four roles in Barker’s play In the Depths of Dead Love, which is set in ancient China, where an exiled poet presides over a bottomless well that is used for suicides. The producing theatre – The Print Room in London – has issued <a href=""http://www.the-print-room.org/depths-dead-love-statement/"">an apology</a> to those offended by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2017/jan/02/theatre-diversity-progress-in-the-depths-of-dead-love"">what protesters call “yellowface” casting</a>, and plans a consultation with the actors’ union Equity on the balance between creative freedom and cultural diversity.</p>    <p>People caught up in such fusses often seem battered and harassed but, when I mention the controversy, Barker’s reaction would make a Zen Buddhist seem ruffled: “Yes, I’ve heard about that.” Had he anticipated the hostility? “No. The ‘Chinese’ nature of the play is within the setting, which is entirely artificial, and the naming of the characters. It’s entirely European in its sensibilities. I’ve only very rarely ever set a play in my own culture – there’s always a distancing effect. You have to understand metaphors. The theatre isn’t a place for literalness.”</p> <p> While the failure to cast racially specific actors seems an obvious wrong to many in a theatre world in which no white actor would now follow the old practice of putting on “blackface” to play Othello, Barker says that, in the major UK productions of Scenes from an Execution, no one condemned Glenda Jackson or Fiona Shaw for stealing the main part from a Venetian actor; nor were there calls for Greek actors to be used in The Bite of the Night, his play about the fall of Troy. The ultimate logic of DNA-based casting would be that only Egyptian members of Equity could be cast as Cleopatra, or those with an Athenian background as Pericles.</p> <p> The playwright says that in productions by <a href=""http://www.thewrestlingschool.co.uk/"">The Wrestling School</a>, the London company that was dedicated to producing Barker’s work from 1988 to 2013, an ensemble of actors played whatever parts were demanded by scripts. “We have to accept as a principle,” he says, “that anyone from any place or culture can play any role.” And that isn’t accepted in large parts of theatre or the liberal media? “That I don’t know. You’re drawing me into the kind of issues that I don’t deal with.” </p> <p>But you must have some interest in the fuss over your play? “Look, the reason I’m a writer is that I don’t involve myself in political and ideological issues. I’m the opposite of writers who enter the theatre to persuade people of their attitudes. It’s not what I do.”</p>    <p>This anti-dogmatism is reflected in In the Depths of Dead Love: the central character, making his well available to those who want to die, could be seen as running an assisted dying scheme. Another type of playwright might have written a play on roughly similar lines, but set in a Swiss clinic. Is the play an oblique contribution to the debate on euthanasia? “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/01/howard-barker-scenes-execution"">I have no attitude to it</a>,” he says. Barker feels “very sorry” for playwrights being asked by theatres to produce a “response” to Brexit or the Trump presidency: “I have contempt for messages in the theatre. I’m not trying to influence anyone.”</p> <p>The furnishings of Barker’s three-storey townhouse are unlike those of most 21st-century homes, in that there is no television – but there is a typewriter, on which he writes most mornings before going to another room in the afternoon to produce paintings and drawings that often reflect or inspire scenes in the plays. Divorced and single, he is able to arrange the house as a factory for the imagination, although there is a neat line of toys and books for visits from grandchildren. </p> <p>He bought the property after writing the 1976 movie Aces High, which relocated RC Sheriff’s trenches drama Journey’s End to the Royal Flying Corps. “Was there ever a more ill-conceived project?” Barker laughs. “Still, I wouldn’t be in this house if I hadn’t written that. Never made any money out of the theatre.” After Aces High, he was hired to write two more screenplays that were not shot. “I was then invited to go to Hollywood and write films. Could have had quite a different life. But I didn’t want to go.”</p>    <p> Each of his new plays is still sent to the National and the Royal Court, but Barker says: “I don’t get a letter back.” There is little interest in the old work either: “The Castle, good play. Victory, good play. Anyone doing them here? No!” BBC radio, an early patron, commissioned a special play for his 60th birthday but not for his 70th, last year. Is he bitter about his profile in Britain? “I think I’m entitled to be. But there’s not much point being bitter about a culture that is as it is.”</p> <p> He sounds grieved, though, when speaking about the decision of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/culture/arts-council-england"">Arts Council England</a> to remove all funding from The Wrestling School: “It is scandalous. We failed continually on the social baggage [required] on application forms for grants. The Arts Council is preposterous, it really belongs in the Soviet era. It’s not really interested in art, it’s interested in sociological benefits.”</p> <p> Pointing out on a side table the three most recent Persian translations of his plays, he laughs: “So who needs England?” And, in a career twist as surprising as Barker’s flirtation with Hollywood, The Wrestling School was supported for three more years by a wealthy American industrialist who had seen a version of Scenes from an Execution. “It was a rather beautiful example of patronage.”</p> <p> Scenes from an Execution is regularly produced around the world but, typically, Barker frets that people like it for the wrong reason: “They think they can agree with it. But it’s nearly always wrongly staged. The character of the painter – who appears to be a feminist, a pacifist, anti-state, anti-Church, in other words she pulls the levers for every liberal humanist prejudice – is also one of the most repulsive characters I have ever created. And that is almost never brought out.”</p>    <p> His problem in England, he thinks, is that he “doesn’t fit the bill”. In the 1970s, he was labelled a leftwing writer along with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/howard-brenton-life-in-theatre"">Howard Brenton</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/03/david-hare-nothing-but-the-truth-about-a-holocaust-denial"">David Hare</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/18/univerisities-against-new-writing-david-edgar"">David Edgar</a>, but his increasingly non-ideological positions confused producers and critics. The closest he comes to a political comment during our conversation is to remark that he would have spent more time at the rehearsals of In the Depths of Dead Love “if <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/southern"">Southern trains</a> allowed”. We had managed to meet in Brighton during a 24-hour respite in strikes.</p> <p> He “hasn’t voted for a very long time”, unable to find a party that would represent his interests. Did the author of numerous plays about European history vote in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum"">EU referendum</a>? “No. To me, ‘European’ is a real identity. And it should have been the business of the European Union to develop it. But they never took it on. Bankers and lawyers is what it has all been about – that’s where it went wrong. They should have celebrated what it means to be a European – the greatest culture in history.”</p> <p> When I leave, the major European playwright England mainly ignores will go upstairs to write the next play for whatever venue will take it. Although his work is often considered off-putting, he wants it to be “seductive” in the sense that the Latin root-word <em>seducere</em> has of “taking to another place”.</p> <p> As he says: “You don’t have to sit in a theatre going, ‘Yes, yes, I agree with that! I recognise that! That’s just like my mother!’ You have to be seduced by the power of an actor and of language. Taking you somewhere you don’t want to go – that’s the point of theatre.”</p> <ul> <li><a href=""http://www.the-print-room.org/theatre/spring-2017-season/depths-dead-love/"">In the Depths of Dead Love is at the Print Room at the Coronet, London, until 11 February</a>.<br></li> </ul>",1514,2017-01-20T10:15:04Z,false,false,2020-03-26T12:35:29Z,NA,UK,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/p/5ytzd,false,true,https://media.guim.co.uk/d532a63da5b261a838472da84035bd7694351618/891_954_5034_3021/500.jpg,false,en,true,"At the bottom of the Brighton street where Howard Barker lives is the seafront house that once belonged to Terence Rattigan.

Barker writes jagged epics that reimagine history, geography and language: The Castle is a version of the Crusades, while Victory fictionalises the English civil war. Although Barker is feted in France – one production there has been running for two years – he has only once been performed at the National: Scenes from an Execution, about a 16th-century Italian painter commissioned to glorify a war victory, was revived there five years ago. Any chance of Barker’s wall ever sporting the sort of blue plaque that marks Rattigan’s former residence has receded further with the latest controversy. In the past, the playwright has tended to offend the political right: the Telegraph railed against the repeated c-words in Victory, while one British theatre director is reputed to have hurled another Barker play, The Europeans, at his office wall, condemning it as simplistically leftwing. The writer’s latest foes, though, are liberals. Many in the theatre world have publicly criticised the casting of white British actors in all four roles in Barker’s play In the Depths of Dead Love, which is set in ancient China, where an exiled poet presides over a bottomless well that is used for suicides. The producing theatre – The Print Room in London – has issued an apology to those offended by what protesters call “yellowface” casting, and plans a consultation with the actors’ union Equity on the balance between creative freedom and cultural diversity. People caught up in such fusses often seem battered and harassed but, when I mention the controversy, Barker’s reaction would make a Zen Buddhist seem ruffled: “Yes, I’ve heard about that.” Had he anticipated the hostility? “No. The ‘Chinese’ nature of the play is within the setting, which is entirely artificial, and the naming of the characters. It’s entirely European in its sensibilities. I’ve only very rarely ever set a play in my own culture – there’s always a distancing effect. You have to understand metaphors. The theatre isn’t a place for literalness.” While the failure to cast racially specific actors seems an obvious wrong to many in a theatre world in which no white actor would now follow the old practice of putting on “blackface” to play Othello, Barker says that, in the major UK productions of Scenes from an Execution, no one condemned Glenda Jackson or Fiona Shaw for stealing the main part from a Venetian actor; nor were there calls for Greek actors to be used in The Bite of the Night, his play about the fall of Troy. The ultimate logic of DNA-based casting would be that only Egyptian members of Equity could be cast as Cleopatra, or those with an Athenian background as Pericles. The playwright says that in productions by The Wrestling School, the London company that was dedicated to producing Barker’s work from 1988 to 2013, an ensemble of actors played whatever parts were demanded by scripts. “We have to accept as a principle,” he says, “that anyone from any place or culture can play any role.” And that isn’t accepted in large parts of theatre or the liberal media? “That I don’t know. You’re drawing me into the kind of issues that I don’t deal with.” But you must have some interest in the fuss over your play? “Look, the reason I’m a writer is that I don’t involve myself in political and ideological issues. I’m the opposite of writers who enter the theatre to persuade people of their attitudes. It’s not what I do.” This anti-dogmatism is reflected in In the Depths of Dead Love: the central character, making his well available to those who want to die, could be seen as running an assisted dying scheme. Another type of playwright might have written a play on roughly similar lines, but set in a Swiss clinic. Is the play an oblique contribution to the debate on euthanasia? “I have no attitude to it,” he says. Barker feels “very sorry” for playwrights being asked by theatres to produce a “response” to Brexit or the Trump presidency: “I have contempt for messages in the theatre. I’m not trying to influence anyone.” The furnishings of Barker’s three-storey townhouse are unlike those of most 21st-century homes, in that there is no television – but there is a typewriter, on which he writes most mornings before going to another room in the afternoon to produce paintings and drawings that often reflect or inspire scenes in the plays. Divorced and single, he is able to arrange the house as a factory for the imagination, although there is a neat line of toys and books for visits from grandchildren. He bought the property after writing the 1976 movie Aces High, which relocated RC Sheriff’s trenches drama Journey’s End to the Royal Flying Corps. “Was there ever a more ill-conceived project?” Barker laughs. “Still, I wouldn’t be in this house if I hadn’t written that. Never made any money out of the theatre.” After Aces High, he was hired to write two more screenplays that were not shot. “I was then invited to go to Hollywood and write films. Could have had quite a different life. But I didn’t want to go.” Each of his new plays is still sent to the National and the Royal Court, but Barker says: “I don’t get a letter back.” There is little interest in the old work either: “The Castle, good play. Victory, good play. Anyone doing them here? No!” BBC radio, an early patron, commissioned a special play for his 60th birthday but not for his 70th, last year. Is he bitter about his profile in Britain? “I think I’m entitled to be. But there’s not much point being bitter about a culture that is as it is.” He sounds grieved, though, when speaking about the decision of Arts Council England to remove all funding from The Wrestling School: “It is scandalous. We failed continually on the social baggage [required] on application forms for grants. The Arts Council is preposterous, it really belongs in the Soviet era. It’s not really interested in art, it’s interested in sociological benefits.” Pointing out on a side table the three most recent Persian translations of his plays, he laughs: “So who needs England?” And, in a career twist as surprising as Barker’s flirtation with Hollywood, The Wrestling School was supported for three more years by a wealthy American industrialist who had seen a version of Scenes from an Execution. “It was a rather beautiful example of patronage.” Scenes from an Execution is regularly produced around the world but, typically, Barker frets that people like it for the wrong reason: “They think they can agree with it. But it’s nearly always wrongly staged. The character of the painter – who appears to be a feminist, a pacifist, anti-state, anti-Church, in other words she pulls the levers for every liberal humanist prejudice – is also one of the most repulsive characters I have ever created. And that is almost never brought out.” His problem in England, he thinks, is that he “doesn’t fit the bill”. In the 1970s, he was labelled a leftwing writer along with Howard Brenton, David Hare and David Edgar, but his increasingly non-ideological positions confused producers and critics. The closest he comes to a political comment during our conversation is to remark that he would have spent more time at the rehearsals of In the Depths of Dead Love “if Southern trains allowed”. We had managed to meet in Brighton during a 24-hour respite in strikes. He “hasn’t voted for a very long time”, unable to find a party that would represent his interests. Did the author of numerous plays about European history vote in the EU referendum? “No. To me, ‘European’ is a real identity. And it should have been the business of the European Union to develop it. But they never took it on. Bankers and lawyers is what it has all been about – that’s where it went wrong. They should have celebrated what it means to be a European – the greatest culture in history.” When I leave, the major European playwright England mainly ignores will go upstairs to write the next play for whatever venue will take it. Although his work is often considered off-putting, he wants it to be “seductive” in the sense that the Latin root-word seducere has of “taking to another place”. As he says: “You don’t have to sit in a theatre going, ‘Yes, yes, I agree with that! I recognise that! That’s just like my mother!’ You have to be seduced by the power of an actor and of language. Taking you somewhere you don’t want to go – that’s the point of theatre.” In the Depths of Dead Love is at the Print Room at the Coronet, London, until 11 February.",8833,Mark Lawson,2017-01-23T10:15:00Z,true,NA,"<a href=""profile/marklawson"">Mark Lawson</a>",16,2017-01-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Not only that, it has a tendency to take other words down with it. “Totes emosh”, “totes cray”: no syllable is safe. All is not lost, however: so omnipresent is “totes” that your grandmother says it to mean “yes”, which means it should be getting measured up for its wooden overcoat pretty soon.</p> <h2><strong>That thing when</strong></h2> <p>A shortcut to starring in your very own scene from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seinfeld"">Seinfeld</a>, “That thing when” attempts to glitter the very dullest of all the concrete: our everyday lives. “That thing when your five-year-old sees Donald Trump on the TV and says he looks like a walnut whip.” “That thing when a girl hits on you in the gym, but you’re married to the weights and gotta say no.” It’s easy to see why it’s popular – “that thing when you sit staring into your phone for hours at a time praying for something, anything, to happen until finally you just make something up” doesn’t quite cut it.</p> <h2><strong>Amaze, or awesomesauce</strong></h2> <p>Awesomesauce may sound like a ketchup business started by the dullest, most bored and married of your friends, but it’s actually a cutesy way of saying something is great, that you like it. It’s an uncomfortably long hug from an overfamiliar stranger, or a double thumbs up from your manager on a team-building day, at the exact moment you decide you never want to join in. “Amaze” is the same, but has wider, more enthusiastic eyes, which it rolls very hard at you when you’re not looking.</p> <h2><strong>Sorry not sorry</strong></h2> <p>This is the battlecry of the wilfully unapologetic, who see themselves as edgy mavericks while they go about their daily business dropping truth bombs (being rude), taking no prisoners (being rude again) and making baristas’, waiters’ and shop assistants’ lives a misery because they’re too important to be polite.</p> <h2><strong>School night</strong></h2> <p>If you wear an itchy uniform, have chemistry in the morning and your alarm clock is a parent, then fine. If you’re kidulting through your 30s and don’t want to stay out for another drink, just say you’re tired: everybody else is, too. But also: live a little, go to work hungover. Again, everybody else is.</p> <h2><strong>Man crush</strong></h2> <p>This is alpha masculinity’s rare nod to homosexuality, which might come after watching a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling"">Ryan Gosling</a> film, realising how cool he is and kind of wanting to be him and marry him all at the same time. Still, it’s better than “no homo”, I guess.</p> <h2><strong>Methinks</strong></h2>    <p>Words you love are dying all over the place, yet this centuries-old signaller of faux-intelligence and an incoming garbage opinion prevails. Used by people who want to come across as clever, authoritative or interesting, but actually sound argumentative and pretentious. And old. “I’ve used this one for years,” Dent admits. Awkward.</p> <h2><strong>The Boy</strong></h2> <p>This sobriquet for the man of your dreams would be charming if he were the lead in a romantic novel. It tends to lose its lustre quite quickly when it becomes clear he’s a crashing, bumbling bore who can’t tuck his shirt into his pants, misses the bowl when he uses the loo, and forgets your birthday every other year. The trouble with The Boy is that he’s mythical. In reality, he’s all grown up; he’s just A Man.</p> <h2><strong>Banter</strong></h2> <p>The moth-eaten cape of respectability afforded to demeaning words, teasing, bullying or harassment. Banter is a secret handshake that permits you to say just about anything you want and nobody can get offended. Anyone who doesn’t fall into line is just being a buzzkill, mate – they’re not even worthy of your bantz. If banter had a face, you would never tire of punching it.</p> <h2><strong>Food baby</strong></h2> <p>Pain is pleasure’s natural pudding, and your eager forays into “nom nom” and #foodporn territory can result in only one thing: a food baby. Parents-to-be proudly pat their distended midriff like nobody ever ate before, but unless that burger is going to somehow pop out of you and demand both your attention and the entire contents of your bank account for the next 18 years (more like 40, who are we kidding?), then it’s not a baby, baby.</p> <h2><strong>I can’t even</strong></h2> <p>Pity the poor “I can’t even” crew – continually presented with situations that render them dumbstruck, able only to react with hands clamped to their face and a wide-eyed stare. Nothing trumps “I can’t even”; not “outraged”, “disgusted” or “horrified”. Once you can’t even, you can’t anything – you’re unmatchable.</p> <h2><strong>Sleeps</strong></h2> <p>“Just two more sleeps until my birthday,” Timmy says as you tuck the covers in tight. There’d be no problem were Timmy a freckly youngster in cartoon pyjamas. Timmy, however, is a middle manager in his 30s and, predictably, his birthday is set to last a whole week, because these things always do. But this isn’t just infantilisation, according to David Crystal, it’s a very old English usage, proving that basicness is one genetic trait we can’t breed out.</p> <h2><strong>Parentals</strong></h2> <p>The disturbingly cold trend for describing your mum and dad as a pair of androids isn’t actually as space age as you might think; this usage was recorded by the OED in the 16th century. “Mothership”, however, when talking about your dear old mum, is newer, but still unacceptable. If she knew you’d said that, she’d be bundling you into an escape pod and shooting you right out into space.</p> <h2><strong>All the feels</strong></h2> <p>Anger, joy, love, pain, misery, shock, excitement: they’re all present and correct, but in between the nerve endings and the mouth, or the typing fingers, they become a rush of something conveniently indefinable. “The feels” is almost an embarrassment, as if you can’t believe something is making you emotional, so you explain it away as “the feels” and hope it will pass. The feels can strike at any time: looking at a baby polar bear, mourning a dead relative or reading about Aleppo – as long as you’ve got your feels handy, there’s no need to, well, say how you actually feel. On the internet, the fact you’re feeling <em>something</em> is usually enough.</p> <h2><strong>#blessed</strong></h2> <p>“I want the good things in my life to look like a happy accident and I also have an overwhelming desire for you to envy me. If we were next-door neighbours, I’d own everything you do, only one price point up.”</p> <h2><strong>Hubby</strong></h2> <p>Most husbands have names – John, Dave, Benoît, even – but if someone really wants you to know they have one, that dude will be known only as “Hubby”. It’s used by those recently wed and bizarrely anxious to show they’re settled and sorted. First recorded in 1600, in 2017 “Hubby” is wrapped in “I have one, you don’t” smugness, a fast-forward to the kind of cosy resentment only 20 years of marriage can bring you. Listen carefully, and you can almost hear Hubby’s slippers shuffling towards you – even though he’s only 29.</p> <h2><strong>Lit</strong></h2> <p>“Pretentious maybe, but quite poetic,” Susie Dent says, “and another move on for lit and its meaning of drunk or high.” Yep, it’s brilliantly expressive when used by cool teens describing the illegal rave they’re at, and definitely works when you’re talking about Beyoncé’s post-Grammys party packed with A-listers. But your dreary barbecue or gathering of thirtysomethings in a conservatory with a leaky roof? Lit it most certainly is not. Bring accelerant.</p> <h2><strong>Cheeky</strong></h2>    <p>Struggling very hard to come out the other side of a huge identity crisis in recent years, is the adjective “cheeky”. It belongs to impudent young rapscallions in the playground, buttocks, Carry On movies. It should not be a conspiratorial wink while you enjoy a gin and tonic, a holiday, a trip to the shops, getting up to something illegal in a cubicle or eating some bloody chicken.</p> <h2><strong>Goals</strong></h2> <p>Envy masquerading as ambition can be quite the driver when it comes to careers, travel or even a “squad” – a bunch of celebrity mates you covet. But when your “goals” relate to a stranger’s bacon sandwich, it might be time to think bigger. Going to the supermarket is not “grocery goals”.

He was at summer camp: “there we were, nearly 20 of us caught in an electric storm in the woods. Someone said we should get to a clearing, and we had to crawl, single file, under a barbed wire fence. As the boy immediately in front of me was going under, lightning struck the fence. I was closer to him than you are to me now; my head was right near his feet.”</p> <p>Auster didn’t realise the boy had died instantly. “So I dragged him into the clearing. And for an hour, as we were pounded by intense rain, and attacked by lightning spears, I was holding on to the boy’s tongue so he didn’t swallow it”. Two or three other kids nearby had also been struck and were moaning; “it was like a war scene. Little by little, the boy’s face was turning blue; his eyes were half open, half shut, the whites were showing.” It took Auster a little while to absorb that, had the strike occurred just a few seconds later, it would have been him. “I’ve always been haunted by what happened, the utter randomness of it,” he says. “I think it was the most important day of my life.”</p> <p>A similar incident occurs in Auster’s new novel, <em>4321</em>. Archie Ferguson, a 13-year-old full of promise, enthralled by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/02/100-best-novels-catcher-in-the-rye-jd-salinger-holden-caulfield""><em>The Catcher in the Rye</em></a> and his first kisses, runs under a tree during a storm at summer camp. When lightning strikes, he is killed by a falling branch: “as his inert body lay on the water-soaked ground … thunder continued to crack, and from one end of the earth to the other, the gods were silent”.</p> <p>But this is the fate of only one of four Archie Fergusons in the novel. Auster’s fiction has always explored the moments in which lives, thanks to chance and circumstance, take different directions, and in <em>4321</em> this idea is presented in its purest form. The novel begins with the birth of Ferguson on 3 March 1947 to Stanley, who runs a furniture-appliance store in Newark, New Jersey, and Rose, who works for a photographer. What follows is four versions of Ferguson’s story. The four Archies have the same starting point – “the same parents, the same bodies, and the same genetic material” – but, as they gallop through childhood and adolescence, they take divergent paths. Each Ferguson lives in a different New Jersey town and has a different configuration of family and friends. As their stories unfold in rotating chapters, they become increasingly distinct people: the influence is felt of money, or the lack of it; divorce; education; and all the other factors that shape early lives. Auster presents four lovingly detailed portrayals of the intensity of youth – of awkwardness and frustration, but also of passion for books, films, sport, politics and sex.</p> <p>All the Archies are bursting with intelligence, and all are aspiring writers. All fall for the captivating Amy Schneiderman, though each relationship plays out in a different way. One Ferguson has a car crash and loses fingers; one is bisexual; one has a friend who dies suddenly; one lives in a garret in Paris rather than going to university; the father of one dies in a fire. It will already be clear that some of the four lives are shorter than others: after the storm in the camp, four Archies becomes three and, as the reader looks ahead, the title of the book takes on a more definite meaning.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Trump’s election is appalling. I’ve been struggling to work out how to live my life in the years ahead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“As far as I know, no one has ever written a novel with this form,” Auster says. Talking in his Brooklyn townhouse, we try to think of comparisons: I come up with Kate Atkinson’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/06/life-after-life-kate-atkinson-review""><em>Life After Life</em></a>; he mentions a film by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/krzysztof-kieslowski"">Krzysztof Kieślowski</a>. But neither are exactly right. “At first, I didn’t know how many Fergusons I wanted to have,” he continues, “I just knew that it was an idea I have been puzzling over all my life.” What he is driving at is not only the role of contingency and the unexpected, but the “what ifs” that haunt us, the imaginary lives we hold in our minds and that run parallel to our actual existence. How might things have turned out had I gone to a different school, or had I not run into the person I married? These are the shadows of our other possible lives (and deaths). “It is a very powerful notion,” Auster believes, “and it drove me through the writing of the novel.”</p> <p><em>4321</em> is published to coincide with Auster’s 70th birthday. He regards it as “the biggest book of my life” – and not just because, at 900 pages, it’s three times as long as any of his other 16 novels (it’s “an elephant”, he admits, “but I hope it’s a sprinting elephant”). In terms of his reputation, he is convinced, it “is going to dominate everything. I feel I’ve waited my whole life to write this book. I’ve been building up to it all these years.”</p> <p>Its writing became urgent to him. “I stayed downstairs in my bunker” – the basement of his brownstone – “and worked almost seven days a week. I wanted to live to finish it.” He pauses to suck on an e-cigarette: two years ago he abandoned the small cigars he had always chain-smoked, and which have given him his much admired raspy voice (“like a piece of sandpaper scraping over a dry roof shingle” he has said). “I started the book at 66, which is the year my father dropped dead of a heart attack. And once I passed that boundary, I began to live in a very creepy world. I’ve settled into it now, but early on, there was a thought of sudden death in my head.”</p> <p>Auster has been a starry presence on the international literary scene for decades, ever since his New York Trilogy in the mid-1980s established him as a fashionable author who could deliver pacy plots with a dash of existentialism and literary theory. The first novel in the trilogy, <em>City of Glass</em>, features a writer, Quinn, who is mistaken for a private eye called Paul Auster: it is a postmodern tale of urban alienation, summed up by an editor as “Kafka goes gumshoe”. With his black clothes and expertise in French poetry, his love of baseball and Samuel Beckett, Auster offered a stylish and accessible intellectualism, East Coast meets Left Bank. He became the best example of an avant-garde writer who had found a mainstream audience.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q-N1tEHi4s""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5q-N1tEHi4s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Paul Auster interviewed at the BFI</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Venerated in France and a bestselling novelist in the rest of Europe, he was less celebrated in his home country, though this changed when, in the mid-90s, he made, with Wayne Wang, the voguish film <em>Smoke</em>, and was involved in other movies. More attention then began to be paid to his delicate, thoughtful works of autobiography, and to such novels as <em>The Music of Chance</em> with its desolate solitary male, hardboiled thrills and its swerve into fable and absurdism. He published frequently, and began to amass a body of work distinctive in its themes and playfulness with form (the nesting of texts within texts, self-referentiality, and so on). His close literary friends – <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/dondelillo"">Don DeLillo</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie"">Salman Rushdie</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/petercarey"">Peter Carey</a> and also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/jmcoetzee"">JM Coetzee</a>, with whom he has published an exchange of letters – are from the premier league, and he is married to the writer<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/16/siri-hustvedt-trump-was-elected-because-misogyny-is-alive-and-well-""> Siri Hustvedt</a>. The couple – Auster soulful and sunken eyed, Hustvedt blonde and elegant – were once asked to appear in a Gap advert as the embodiment of metropolitan literary cool. These days, Auster is more of an old-timer, a Brooklyn institution, but his stature is unquestioned.</p> <p>He has also been unafraid to make his voice heard politically, as a member of literature’s left-leaning establishment, and it’s hard at this moment to avoid the subject of America’s new president: “It’s all I’m thinking about right now”. Auster has in the past stood against the Iraq war and George W Bush, and he got into a public spat with the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over imprisoned writers. On the eve of the recent American election, he described himself as “on the verge of a nervous breakdown”. Donald Trump’s message of “Make America Great Again” was, he argued, “really Make America White Again … I’ve never been in more despair about who we are and where we’re going.”</p> <p>In the wake of Trump’s victory, he says, “I feel utterly astonished that we could have come to this. I find his election the most appalling thing I’ve seen in politics in my life.” The Russians <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/dnc-hillary-clinton-emails-hacked-russia-aide-typo-investigation-finds"">hacking the Democratic party</a> is “almost like a declaration of war, without bullets”. “I’ve been struggling ever since Trump won to work out how to live my life in the years ahead,” he says. And he has decided to act: “I have come to the conclusion to accept something that has been offered to me again and again over the years – to become president of PEN America. I have been vice-president, and secretary, but I’ve never wanted to take on the full burden. I’ll start early in 2018. I’m going to speak out as often as I can, otherwise I don’t think I can live with myself.”</p> <p>In <em>4321</em> the young Fergusons react to landmark events of 1960s US history: the civil rights movement and JF Kennedy’s assassination, the Vietnam war and the student protests at Columbia University in 1968. I ask Auster if there any connections to be made between then and now. “Tumultuous as those times were, they weren’t as depressing as what’s going on today,” he reflects. “How little has changed in American life since then. Race is still a very big problem. Stupid foreign policy decisions are still being made. And the country is just as divided now as it was then. It seems as though America has always been split between the people who believe in the individual above everything else, and those people who believe we’re responsible for one another.”</p> <p>Auster has spent much of the last decade thinking about his childhood and the America he grew up in. When in his 50s, and after suffering a few bouts of ill health, he wrote a series of novels that centred on debilitated men (<em>Timbuktu</em>, <em>The Book of Illusions</em>, <em>Oracle Night</em>) and the presence of the dead in the thoughts of the living. During his 60s, however, Auster has gone back in time. (He has often mentioned a line from the poet<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/29/specificreasonstorememberg""> George Oppen</a> about growing old: “what a strange thing to happen to a little boy”.) His 13th novel, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/14/invisible-paul-auster-book-review""><em>Invisible</em></a>, featured a student at Columbia in the late 60s – when Auster studied there. And the author’s two recent fragments of autobiography, <em>Winter Journal</em> and <em>Report from the Interior</em>, are lyrical attempts to recall the sensations and thought patterns of his childhood self. “I think those two books laid the groundwork for this novel,” he says. “Without having dwelt in that land of long ago, I don’t think <em>4321</em> would have occurred to me.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Ferguson, as Auster did, begins his teenage years in 1960: “I wanted to give a sense of what it felt like to grow up then”, the writer says: the new novel is a “story of human development … and I worked hard thinking about the different stages” of a young person’s life. “His mother’s name was Rose,” Ferguson 1’s story begins, “and when he was big enough to tie his shoes and stop wetting the bed, he was going to marry her.” <em>4321</em> is intent on conveying the way Archie, in all his incarnations, is formed both by personal drives and public events. The day Kennedy is shot is also the day Ferguson 1 has sex with Amy for the first time: they watch the coverage for hours on TV and then tumble into bed. (Any conjuring of a teenager’s life has to engage with the “obsessive thinking about sex”– Auster recalls that “it’s hard to get another thought in your head”.)</p> <p>History unfolds: one Ferguson reports that in Alabama state troopers have attacked civil rights demonstrators in Selma, and that the Vietnam draft quotas have been doubled. A stepfather arrives on the scene, sport takes centre stage, cars are driven for the first time, <em>Candide</em> is devoured, Lyndon Johnson’s record is assessed. All the Fergusons are in a state of plasticity, on the way to being formed. They are all notably precocious, sensitive, likable and right-thinking: Auster wants to capture “the nature of the havoc roiling inside” Archie, “the contradictory muddle of hard, unforgiving judgments and raging contempt for big-dollar American greed, combined with an overall gentleness of spirit … his good-boy rectitude and out-of-step clumsiness with his own heart.”</p> <p>Auster’s urge to convey youthful intensity in <em>4321</em> has induced him to change his style (in the past his work has been criticised for being too formulaic). He describes it as the “most ‘realistic’ novel I’ve written … The structure has a speculative feel to it, but it’s very down to earth.” There is nothing noirish about the book, there are no borrowings from genre fiction, and there is no evidence either of what used to be his trademark minimalism: <em>4321</em> not only teems with detail but is written in long, breathless sentences – some spilling over pages.</p>    <p>“I’ve been building up to this in my recent books,” he continues. “And I felt a certain liberation in writing a sentence that goes on for three pages. It creates such a forcefield of energy.” It’s not stream of consciousness, but “as a reader you are following the thought processes of the characters”; the aim is to be propulsive. He has Ferguson 4 dismiss the usual writing advice of “show not tell” in favour of “tell and tell and tell”, and Auster says <em>4321</em> is itself a case of “telling and telling”. As such, the novel “contains a lot of the things I’ve been thinking about over all these years, and yet presented in a wholly different way”.</p> <p>This is not to say <em>4321</em> abandons his themes or all of his metafictional trickery. In the detailing of Ferguson’s involvement in the Columbia University sit-ins, for instance, other characters from Auster novels who are graduates from his alma mater make an appearance – Marco Stanley Fogg from <em>Moon Palace</em>, David Zimmer from <em>The Book of Illusions</em>, Peter Aaron from <em>Leviathan</em>, Adam Walker from <em>Invisible</em>. The reader, as so often with Auster, steps momentarily into a hall of mirrors. “Yes, they are all there,” he confirms. “I wanted to bring back all my boys and have them there at the same time … just for fun. It’s a link in my work.”</p> <p>Similarly, in the novel’s final pages, a crucial sentence refers to the “endlessly forking paths a person must confront as he walks through life”. This is a nod to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/jorgeluisborges"">Jorge Luis Borges</a> – a writer often cited in discussions of the New York Trilogy – and his story “The Garden of Forking Paths”, at the centre of which is, appropriately enough, a novel where all possible outcomes of an event take place simultaneously. For those so inclined, there are plenty of other references to spot (for example the Princeton professor Nagle is an homage Auster’s friend, the celebrated translator Robert Fagles). More significantly, <em>4321</em> ends with a characteristic piece of illusionism that changes the nature of the novel entirely.</p> <p><em>4321</em> is also typical in drawing on Auster’s own experiences. We know from reading his memoirs that he, like Ferguson 3, lived in a top floor maid’s room in Paris as a young man; that he, too, visited prostitutes – the parallels are too numerous to mention. In fact for readers familiar with Auster’s work, the novel is almost an echo chamber, with familiar themes and episodes – including the lightning story, which he has told elsewhere – reverberating within the multiple Ferguson narratives. The author has, it seems, poured his whole life into this book.</p> <p>“I borrowed some things from my own life,” Auster says, “but what novelist doesn’t?” Unlike other writers, however, he rarely shuts down such conversations with a weary reminder that fiction involves making things up, but tends instead to volunteer exactly what in each book has been lifted from his own life. One instance from <em>4321</em> is a basketball match, played by Ferguson 4, which ends with a miraculous fluke of a shot and a fight between black kids and white kids. He was at such a match, and “it was very demoralising for me,” he remembers, “I was 14 and filled with idealism.” He mentions a character who is a direct representation of a friend’s father – a man full of wonderful stories of “sea voyages and women’s stockings and wireless, and his first martini”. And “I used my grandparents’ apartment,” he adds, “in a building on the corner of Central Park that wraps around to 58th St right to Columbus Circle.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>I am trying to represent the world that I know – the reality that I have experienced, which is so full of surprises</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The borrowings go beyond incidents and places to include enthusiasms. Auster is able to indulge his well-known love of Laurel and Hardy when a troubled Ferguson 2 watches their films repeatedly at home on a projector screen. The novelist resurrects his own past as a student translator of French poetry (Ferguson 1 has a similar inclination) with a new rendering of a poem by Apollinaire. He even inserts into the narrative a text he wrote aged 19 called “The Droons” – described as Ferguson 4’s “most crackpot effort so far” – which includes the incomparable line: “After three days and three nights, I arrived at the village of Flom”. It is “pretty much word-for-word,” Auster says: “I thought: this is what I sounded like at 19, so why meddle with it?”</p> <p>The narrative of the Columbia sit-ins is “accurately told” – done as “straight history”. In 1967 Auster himself took part in the protests, “got arrested, got kicked by the cops: I’m very glad I did it”. At one heady moment of student insurrection, he knew seven out of 10 men on the FBI’s most wanted list.</p> <p>The retelling of anecdotes in Auster’s different books and the repetition of episodes from his own life have attracted some flak. Given Ferguson’s intellectual sparkle and progressive views, the author might be said to have opened himself up to the charge, made by an early reviewer of <em>4321</em>, that he has “written a very long chronicle of his own genius”. Another review has referred to the “magnetic pull of Auster’s fascination with his own biography”. Readers of the new novel who don’t know his work simply won’t care, and the novelist, who always has mischief on his side against the critics, knows there is no simple correspondence between himself and Ferguson, and cares little about any overlappings in his work: “I am trying to represent in my fiction the world that I know – the reality that I have lived through and experienced, which is so full of surprises, and befuddling, and just not what one expects at all.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Auster likes to pinpoint his beginnings as a writer to the day when, aged eight, he met his baseball hero Willie Mays at a New York Giants game and, mustering all his courage, asked him for an autograph. But neither his father nor his mother had a pencil, and eventually the player shrugged and walked away. Auster cried, and hated himself for crying, but from that day on – so the story goes – never left home without a pencil: “If there’s a pencil in your pocket, there’s a good chance that one day you’ll feel tempted to start using it” (52 years after the game, Mays gave him a signed ball).</p> <p>Auster’s breakthrough with the New York Trilogy came when he was in his late 30s (and even then <em>City of Glass</em> was rejected by 17 publishers). He has written engagingly about the long years before that success, particularly in the memoir <em>Hand to Mouth</em>, which is subtitled “A Chronicle of Early Failure” (his early jobs included working on an Esso oil tanker). From 1971, he lived in France with the writer Lydia Davis, whom he had met in college. They eked out an existence as critics and translators and shared a belief that their poverty was romantic – until the situation grew desperate. They eventually returned to the US, with nine dollars to their name, and were married in 1974. The following year, expecting a child – their son, Daniel – the couple bought an old house in Duchess County, New York. On their arrival, Auster knew they had made a mistake. On the back porch were old pro-Nazi pamphlets and a copy of <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, and when moving a wardrobe Auster found a desiccated crow – “a classic omen of bad tidings”.</p> <p>The following years were the bleakest of his life. He was so hard up, he touted around a baseball game he had invented using playing cards, and considered responding to an ad that promised “Make Money Growing Worms in Your Basement”. “I had spent my whole life avoiding the subject of money,” he writes in <em>Hand to Mouth</em>, “and now, suddenly, I could think of nothing else.” His turbulent marriage to Davis ended in 1978, and Auster faced what he has called a “very bad crisis”: “the ground was opening up … the things you clung to were no longer there”.</p> <p>The death of his father, Sam, the following year (he had a heart attack while having sex with his girlfriend) triggered a change. Not only did a small inheritance enable Auster to keep writing, but he immediately embarked on a book of prose written in search of his remote, absent father, which became the superb memoir <em>The Invention of Solitude</em>. Most shocking was his discovery that in 1919 his grandmother had shot and killed his grandfather. She was acquitted on grounds of temporary insanity and her five children never mentioned the scandal; Sam Auster was eight years old at the time: “A boy cannot live through this kind of thing without being affected by it as a man.”</p> <p>In 1981, the year before <em>The Invention of Solitude</em> was published, Auster met Hustvedt at a poetry reading. “The family joke,” she has said, “is that it took me about 60 seconds to fall really hard, and it took him several hours. It was a really fast bit of business.” Auster has often said that she saved him: “It sounds sentimental, because we’ve been together now 36 years,” he tells me, “but she is far and away the most intelligent person I’ve ever known.” She is always his first reader, and “hasn’t made a suggestion that I haven’t followed”. Hustvedt has recently published a collection of essays entitled <em>A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women</em>, and I ask Auster whether she has ever picked him up on his representations of women. “Never,” he replies. “I’ve learned so much from her over the years. She’s an ardent feminist and I agree with her in all her positions. They are mine as well.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Auster’s life-changing meeting with Hustvedt is, for him, a perfect example of the “befuddling” workings of contingency. In the same vein, he says that had he not received a wrong-number phone call (twice) from a man asking for the Pinkerton’s detective agency, he would never have written <em>City of Glass</em>. Such an interpretation of events can be pushed too far, or seem routine, but Auster has a deep affinity for tales of coincidence and the uncanny. “People who don’t like my work say that the connections seem too arbitrary. But that’s how life is.”</p> <p>As if to prove it, between 1999 and 2001 he took part in the National Story Project on American public radio, in which he read out yarns submitted by “ordinary people” across the country – “true stories that sounded like fiction”. His original call was for tales “that defied our expectations about the world, anecdotes that revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives”. It was a success; thousands of stories were submitted and a selection published as <em>True Tales of American Life</em>. Auster found confirmation that “reality is truly as strange and incomprehensible as I thought it was”, and that others too felt the pull of improbability: “I’m happy to report that I’m not alone,” he told the Paris Review. “It’s a madhouse out there.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--supporting""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/16/siri-hustvedt-trump-was-elected-because-misogyny-is-alive-and-well-"">Siri Hustvedt: ‘Trump was elected because misogyny is alive and well’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the very beginning and end of <em>4321</em> is a joke about chance. It’s an adaptation of an old joke about a Jewish immigrant to the US that is apparently used by tour guides to Ellis Island. Before being interviewed by the immigration official, Archie’s grandfather, Isaac Reznikoff, is advised by a fellow Russian Jew to choose a new, American-sounding name, such as Rockefeller. But when the interview takes place, he forgets the name, slaps his head in frustration and blurts out in Yiddish, “<em>Ikh hob fargessen</em> (“I’ve forgotten”). The official thus writes his name down as “Ferguson” – a single moment with major consequences. (Auster says he originally intended to call the novel “Ferguson”, but had to change the title following the controversial shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri – “Now it’s a name that’ll be in American history for a long time”.)</p> <p>Auster produced <em>4321</em> keeping to his celebrated old-school habits – in particular his dedication to writing in longhand, and his use of the trusty Olympia typewriter that has been on his desk since 1974. He has even published a book, with the artist Sam Messer, called <em>The Story of My Typewriter</em>, some of the original artworks from which hang above Auster as he talks to me. He likes the sound the keys make, he has said, but turns to the Olympia only once a paragraph he has worked on in his quadrille notebooks seems finished. He dislikes computers and thinks Amazon is “the enemy”. Each day, having worked for six hours on the new novel, he felt “depleted”: writing books is “exhausting, physically and mentally”. With Hustvedt, he would usually unwind by watching a classic film.</p> <p>According to Auster, “only a person who really felt compelled to do it would shut himself up in a room every day … When I think about the alternatives – how beautiful life can be, how interesting – I think it’s a crazy way to live your life.” Dwelling again on Trump and the state of America, he remarks that he has often been tormented by the question he puts into the mouth of Ferguson 4: “If the world is on fire”, what use are works of fiction? “When you have a social conscience, there is a great push and pull inside of you about how to spend your time” and he has “never really come up with an answer”. But there remains the “hunger to write”, he insists, “to keep doing it”, even if the good sentences refuse to come. The “excitement, the struggle, is emboldening and vivifying. I just feel more alive writing.”</p> <p>• <em>4321</em> is published by Faber on 31 January.

He was at summer camp: “there we were, nearly 20 of us caught in an electric storm in the woods. Someone said we should get to a clearing, and we had to crawl, single file, under a barbed wire fence. As the boy immediately in front of me was going under, lightning struck the fence. I was closer to him than you are to me now; my head was right near his feet.” Auster didn’t realise the boy had died instantly. “So I dragged him into the clearing. And for an hour, as we were pounded by intense rain, and attacked by lightning spears, I was holding on to the boy’s tongue so he didn’t swallow it”. Two or three other kids nearby had also been struck and were moaning; “it was like a war scene. Little by little, the boy’s face was turning blue; his eyes were half open, half shut, the whites were showing.” It took Auster a little while to absorb that, had the strike occurred just a few seconds later, it would have been him. “I’ve always been haunted by what happened, the utter randomness of it,” he says. “I think it was the most important day of my life.” A similar incident occurs in Auster’s new novel, 4321. Archie Ferguson, a 13-year-old full of promise, enthralled by The Catcher in the Rye and his first kisses, runs under a tree during a storm at summer camp. When lightning strikes, he is killed by a falling branch: “as his inert body lay on the water-soaked ground … thunder continued to crack, and from one end of the earth to the other, the gods were silent”. But this is the fate of only one of four Archie Fergusons in the novel. Auster’s fiction has always explored the moments in which lives, thanks to chance and circumstance, take different directions, and in 4321 this idea is presented in its purest form. The novel begins with the birth of Ferguson on 3 March 1947 to Stanley, who runs a furniture-appliance store in Newark, New Jersey, and Rose, who works for a photographer. What follows is four versions of Ferguson’s story. The four Archies have the same starting point – “the same parents, the same bodies, and the same genetic material” – but, as they gallop through childhood and adolescence, they take divergent paths. Each Ferguson lives in a different New Jersey town and has a different configuration of family and friends. As their stories unfold in rotating chapters, they become increasingly distinct people: the influence is felt of money, or the lack of it; divorce; education; and all the other factors that shape early lives. Auster presents four lovingly detailed portrayals of the intensity of youth – of awkwardness and frustration, but also of passion for books, films, sport, politics and sex. All the Archies are bursting with intelligence, and all are aspiring writers. All fall for the captivating Amy Schneiderman, though each relationship plays out in a different way. One Ferguson has a car crash and loses fingers; one is bisexual; one has a friend who dies suddenly; one lives in a garret in Paris rather than going to university; the father of one dies in a fire. It will already be clear that some of the four lives are shorter than others: after the storm in the camp, four Archies becomes three and, as the reader looks ahead, the title of the book takes on a more definite meaning. “As far as I know, no one has ever written a novel with this form,” Auster says. Talking in his Brooklyn townhouse, we try to think of comparisons: I come up with Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life; he mentions a film by Krzysztof Kieślowski. But neither are exactly right. “At first, I didn’t know how many Fergusons I wanted to have,” he continues, “I just knew that it was an idea I have been puzzling over all my life.” What he is driving at is not only the role of contingency and the unexpected, but the “what ifs” that haunt us, the imaginary lives we hold in our minds and that run parallel to our actual existence. How might things have turned out had I gone to a different school, or had I not run into the person I married? These are the shadows of our other possible lives (and deaths). “It is a very powerful notion,” Auster believes, “and it drove me through the writing of the novel.” 4321 is published to coincide with Auster’s 70th birthday. He regards it as “the biggest book of my life” – and not just because, at 900 pages, it’s three times as long as any of his other 16 novels (it’s “an elephant”, he admits, “but I hope it’s a sprinting elephant”). In terms of his reputation, he is convinced, it “is going to dominate everything. I feel I’ve waited my whole life to write this book. I’ve been building up to it all these years.” Its writing became urgent to him. “I stayed downstairs in my bunker” – the basement of his brownstone – “and worked almost seven days a week. I wanted to live to finish it.” He pauses to suck on an e-cigarette: two years ago he abandoned the small cigars he had always chain-smoked, and which have given him his much admired raspy voice (“like a piece of sandpaper scraping over a dry roof shingle” he has said). “I started the book at 66, which is the year my father dropped dead of a heart attack. And once I passed that boundary, I began to live in a very creepy world. I’ve settled into it now, but early on, there was a thought of sudden death in my head.” Auster has been a starry presence on the international literary scene for decades, ever since his New York Trilogy in the mid-1980s established him as a fashionable author who could deliver pacy plots with a dash of existentialism and literary theory. The first novel in the trilogy, City of Glass, features a writer, Quinn, who is mistaken for a private eye called Paul Auster: it is a postmodern tale of urban alienation, summed up by an editor as “Kafka goes gumshoe”. With his black clothes and expertise in French poetry, his love of baseball and Samuel Beckett, Auster offered a stylish and accessible intellectualism, East Coast meets Left Bank. He became the best example of an avant-garde writer who had found a mainstream audience. Venerated in France and a bestselling novelist in the rest of Europe, he was less celebrated in his home country, though this changed when, in the mid-90s, he made, with Wayne Wang, the voguish film Smoke, and was involved in other movies. More attention then began to be paid to his delicate, thoughtful works of autobiography, and to such novels as The Music of Chance with its desolate solitary male, hardboiled thrills and its swerve into fable and absurdism. He published frequently, and began to amass a body of work distinctive in its themes and playfulness with form (the nesting of texts within texts, self-referentiality, and so on). His close literary friends – Don DeLillo, Salman Rushdie, Peter Carey and also JM Coetzee, with whom he has published an exchange of letters – are from the premier league, and he is married to the writer Siri Hustvedt. The couple – Auster soulful and sunken eyed, Hustvedt blonde and elegant – were once asked to appear in a Gap advert as the embodiment of metropolitan literary cool. These days, Auster is more of an old-timer, a Brooklyn institution, but his stature is unquestioned. He has also been unafraid to make his voice heard politically, as a member of literature’s left-leaning establishment, and it’s hard at this moment to avoid the subject of America’s new president: “It’s all I’m thinking about right now”. Auster has in the past stood against the Iraq war and George W Bush, and he got into a public spat with the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over imprisoned writers. On the eve of the recent American election, he described himself as “on the verge of a nervous breakdown”. Donald Trump’s message of “Make America Great Again” was, he argued, “really Make America White Again … I’ve never been in more despair about who we are and where we’re going.” In the wake of Trump’s victory, he says, “I feel utterly astonished that we could have come to this. I find his election the most appalling thing I’ve seen in politics in my life.” The Russians hacking the Democratic party is “almost like a declaration of war, without bullets”. “I’ve been struggling ever since Trump won to work out how to live my life in the years ahead,” he says. And he has decided to act: “I have come to the conclusion to accept something that has been offered to me again and again over the years – to become president of PEN America. I have been vice-president, and secretary, but I’ve never wanted to take on the full burden. I’ll start early in 2018. I’m going to speak out as often as I can, otherwise I don’t think I can live with myself.” In 4321 the young Fergusons react to landmark events of 1960s US history: the civil rights movement and JF Kennedy’s assassination, the Vietnam war and the student protests at Columbia University in 1968. I ask Auster if there any connections to be made between then and now. “Tumultuous as those times were, they weren’t as depressing as what’s going on today,” he reflects. “How little has changed in American life since then. Race is still a very big problem. Stupid foreign policy decisions are still being made. And the country is just as divided now as it was then. It seems as though America has always been split between the people who believe in the individual above everything else, and those people who believe we’re responsible for one another.” Auster has spent much of the last decade thinking about his childhood and the America he grew up in. When in his 50s, and after suffering a few bouts of ill health, he wrote a series of novels that centred on debilitated men (Timbuktu, The Book of Illusions, Oracle Night) and the presence of the dead in the thoughts of the living. During his 60s, however, Auster has gone back in time. (He has often mentioned a line from the poet George Oppen about growing old: “what a strange thing to happen to a little boy”.) His 13th novel, Invisible, featured a student at Columbia in the late 60s – when Auster studied there. And the author’s two recent fragments of autobiography, Winter Journal and Report from the Interior, are lyrical attempts to recall the sensations and thought patterns of his childhood self. “I think those two books laid the groundwork for this novel,” he says. “Without having dwelt in that land of long ago, I don’t think 4321 would have occurred to me.” *** Ferguson, as Auster did, begins his teenage years in 1960: “I wanted to give a sense of what it felt like to grow up then”, the writer says: the new novel is a “story of human development … and I worked hard thinking about the different stages” of a young person’s life. “His mother’s name was Rose,” Ferguson 1’s story begins, “and when he was big enough to tie his shoes and stop wetting the bed, he was going to marry her.” 4321 is intent on conveying the way Archie, in all his incarnations, is formed both by personal drives and public events. The day Kennedy is shot is also the day Ferguson 1 has sex with Amy for the first time: they watch the coverage for hours on TV and then tumble into bed. (Any conjuring of a teenager’s life has to engage with the “obsessive thinking about sex”– Auster recalls that “it’s hard to get another thought in your head”.) History unfolds: one Ferguson reports that in Alabama state troopers have attacked civil rights demonstrators in Selma, and that the Vietnam draft quotas have been doubled. A stepfather arrives on the scene, sport takes centre stage, cars are driven for the first time, Candide is devoured, Lyndon Johnson’s record is assessed. All the Fergusons are in a state of plasticity, on the way to being formed. They are all notably precocious, sensitive, likable and right-thinking: Auster wants to capture “the nature of the havoc roiling inside” Archie, “the contradictory muddle of hard, unforgiving judgments and raging contempt for big-dollar American greed, combined with an overall gentleness of spirit … his good-boy rectitude and out-of-step clumsiness with his own heart.” Auster’s urge to convey youthful intensity in 4321 has induced him to change his style (in the past his work has been criticised for being too formulaic). He describes it as the “most ‘realistic’ novel I’ve written … The structure has a speculative feel to it, but it’s very down to earth.” There is nothing noirish about the book, there are no borrowings from genre fiction, and there is no evidence either of what used to be his trademark minimalism: 4321 not only teems with detail but is written in long, breathless sentences – some spilling over pages. “I’ve been building up to this in my recent books,” he continues. “And I felt a certain liberation in writing a sentence that goes on for three pages. It creates such a forcefield of energy.” It’s not stream of consciousness, but “as a reader you are following the thought processes of the characters”; the aim is to be propulsive. He has Ferguson 4 dismiss the usual writing advice of “show not tell” in favour of “tell and tell and tell”, and Auster says 4321 is itself a case of “telling and telling”. As such, the novel “contains a lot of the things I’ve been thinking about over all these years, and yet presented in a wholly different way”. This is not to say 4321 abandons his themes or all of his metafictional trickery. In the detailing of Ferguson’s involvement in the Columbia University sit-ins, for instance, other characters from Auster novels who are graduates from his alma mater make an appearance – Marco Stanley Fogg from Moon Palace, David Zimmer from The Book of Illusions, Peter Aaron from Leviathan, Adam Walker from Invisible. The reader, as so often with Auster, steps momentarily into a hall of mirrors. “Yes, they are all there,” he confirms. “I wanted to bring back all my boys and have them there at the same time … just for fun. It’s a link in my work.” Similarly, in the novel’s final pages, a crucial sentence refers to the “endlessly forking paths a person must confront as he walks through life”. This is a nod to Jorge Luis Borges – a writer often cited in discussions of the New York Trilogy – and his story “The Garden of Forking Paths”, at the centre of which is, appropriately enough, a novel where all possible outcomes of an event take place simultaneously. For those so inclined, there are plenty of other references to spot (for example the Princeton professor Nagle is an homage Auster’s friend, the celebrated translator Robert Fagles). More significantly, 4321 ends with a characteristic piece of illusionism that changes the nature of the novel entirely. 4321 is also typical in drawing on Auster’s own experiences. We know from reading his memoirs that he, like Ferguson 3, lived in a top floor maid’s room in Paris as a young man; that he, too, visited prostitutes – the parallels are too numerous to mention. In fact for readers familiar with Auster’s work, the novel is almost an echo chamber, with familiar themes and episodes – including the lightning story, which he has told elsewhere – reverberating within the multiple Ferguson narratives. The author has, it seems, poured his whole life into this book. “I borrowed some things from my own life,” Auster says, “but what novelist doesn’t?” Unlike other writers, however, he rarely shuts down such conversations with a weary reminder that fiction involves making things up, but tends instead to volunteer exactly what in each book has been lifted from his own life. One instance from 4321 is a basketball match, played by Ferguson 4, which ends with a miraculous fluke of a shot and a fight between black kids and white kids. He was at such a match, and “it was very demoralising for me,” he remembers, “I was 14 and filled with idealism.” He mentions a character who is a direct representation of a friend’s father – a man full of wonderful stories of “sea voyages and women’s stockings and wireless, and his first martini”. And “I used my grandparents’ apartment,” he adds, “in a building on the corner of Central Park that wraps around to 58th St right to Columbus Circle.” The borrowings go beyond incidents and places to include enthusiasms. Auster is able to indulge his well-known love of Laurel and Hardy when a troubled Ferguson 2 watches their films repeatedly at home on a projector screen. The novelist resurrects his own past as a student translator of French poetry (Ferguson 1 has a similar inclination) with a new rendering of a poem by Apollinaire. He even inserts into the narrative a text he wrote aged 19 called “The Droons” – described as Ferguson 4’s “most crackpot effort so far” – which includes the incomparable line: “After three days and three nights, I arrived at the village of Flom”. It is “pretty much word-for-word,” Auster says: “I thought: this is what I sounded like at 19, so why meddle with it?” The narrative of the Columbia sit-ins is “accurately told” – done as “straight history”. In 1967 Auster himself took part in the protests, “got arrested, got kicked by the cops: I’m very glad I did it”. At one heady moment of student insurrection, he knew seven out of 10 men on the FBI’s most wanted list. The retelling of anecdotes in Auster’s different books and the repetition of episodes from his own life have attracted some flak. Given Ferguson’s intellectual sparkle and progressive views, the author might be said to have opened himself up to the charge, made by an early reviewer of 4321, that he has “written a very long chronicle of his own genius”. Another review has referred to the “magnetic pull of Auster’s fascination with his own biography”. Readers of the new novel who don’t know his work simply won’t care, and the novelist, who always has mischief on his side against the critics, knows there is no simple correspondence between himself and Ferguson, and cares little about any overlappings in his work: “I am trying to represent in my fiction the world that I know – the reality that I have lived through and experienced, which is so full of surprises, and befuddling, and just not what one expects at all.” *** Auster likes to pinpoint his beginnings as a writer to the day when, aged eight, he met his baseball hero Willie Mays at a New York Giants game and, mustering all his courage, asked him for an autograph. But neither his father nor his mother had a pencil, and eventually the player shrugged and walked away. Auster cried, and hated himself for crying, but from that day on – so the story goes – never left home without a pencil: “If there’s a pencil in your pocket, there’s a good chance that one day you’ll feel tempted to start using it” (52 years after the game, Mays gave him a signed ball). Auster’s breakthrough with the New York Trilogy came when he was in his late 30s (and even then City of Glass was rejected by 17 publishers). He has written engagingly about the long years before that success, particularly in the memoir Hand to Mouth, which is subtitled “A Chronicle of Early Failure” (his early jobs included working on an Esso oil tanker). From 1971, he lived in France with the writer Lydia Davis, whom he had met in college. They eked out an existence as critics and translators and shared a belief that their poverty was romantic – until the situation grew desperate. They eventually returned to the US, with nine dollars to their name, and were married in 1974. The following year, expecting a child – their son, Daniel – the couple bought an old house in Duchess County, New York. On their arrival, Auster knew they had made a mistake. On the back porch were old pro-Nazi pamphlets and a copy of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and when moving a wardrobe Auster found a desiccated crow – “a classic omen of bad tidings”. The following years were the bleakest of his life. He was so hard up, he touted around a baseball game he had invented using playing cards, and considered responding to an ad that promised “Make Money Growing Worms in Your Basement”. “I had spent my whole life avoiding the subject of money,” he writes in Hand to Mouth, “and now, suddenly, I could think of nothing else.” His turbulent marriage to Davis ended in 1978, and Auster faced what he has called a “very bad crisis”: “the ground was opening up … the things you clung to were no longer there”. The death of his father, Sam, the following year (he had a heart attack while having sex with his girlfriend) triggered a change. Not only did a small inheritance enable Auster to keep writing, but he immediately embarked on a book of prose written in search of his remote, absent father, which became the superb memoir The Invention of Solitude. Most shocking was his discovery that in 1919 his grandmother had shot and killed his grandfather. She was acquitted on grounds of temporary insanity and her five children never mentioned the scandal; Sam Auster was eight years old at the time: “A boy cannot live through this kind of thing without being affected by it as a man.” In 1981, the year before The Invention of Solitude was published, Auster met Hustvedt at a poetry reading. “The family joke,” she has said, “is that it took me about 60 seconds to fall really hard, and it took him several hours. It was a really fast bit of business.” Auster has often said that she saved him: “It sounds sentimental, because we’ve been together now 36 years,” he tells me, “but she is far and away the most intelligent person I’ve ever known.” She is always his first reader, and “hasn’t made a suggestion that I haven’t followed”. Hustvedt has recently published a collection of essays entitled A Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women, and I ask Auster whether she has ever picked him up on his representations of women. “Never,” he replies. “I’ve learned so much from her over the years. She’s an ardent feminist and I agree with her in all her positions. They are mine as well.” *** Auster’s life-changing meeting with Hustvedt is, for him, a perfect example of the “befuddling” workings of contingency. In the same vein, he says that had he not received a wrong-number phone call (twice) from a man asking for the Pinkerton’s detective agency, he would never have written City of Glass. Such an interpretation of events can be pushed too far, or seem routine, but Auster has a deep affinity for tales of coincidence and the uncanny. “People who don’t like my work say that the connections seem too arbitrary. But that’s how life is.” As if to prove it, between 1999 and 2001 he took part in the National Story Project on American public radio, in which he read out yarns submitted by “ordinary people” across the country – “true stories that sounded like fiction”. His original call was for tales “that defied our expectations about the world, anecdotes that revealed the mysterious and unknowable forces at work in our lives”. It was a success; thousands of stories were submitted and a selection published as True Tales of American Life. Auster found confirmation that “reality is truly as strange and incomprehensible as I thought it was”, and that others too felt the pull of improbability: “I’m happy to report that I’m not alone,” he told the Paris Review. “It’s a madhouse out there.” At the very beginning and end of 4321 is a joke about chance. It’s an adaptation of an old joke about a Jewish immigrant to the US that is apparently used by tour guides to Ellis Island. Before being interviewed by the immigration official, Archie’s grandfather, Isaac Reznikoff, is advised by a fellow Russian Jew to choose a new, American-sounding name, such as Rockefeller. But when the interview takes place, he forgets the name, slaps his head in frustration and blurts out in Yiddish, “Ikh hob fargessen (“I’ve forgotten”). The official thus writes his name down as “Ferguson” – a single moment with major consequences. (Auster says he originally intended to call the novel “Ferguson”, but had to change the title following the controversial shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri – “Now it’s a name that’ll be in American history for a long time”.) Auster produced 4321 keeping to his celebrated old-school habits – in particular his dedication to writing in longhand, and his use of the trusty Olympia typewriter that has been on his desk since 1974. He has even published a book, with the artist Sam Messer, called The Story of My Typewriter, some of the original artworks from which hang above Auster as he talks to me. He likes the sound the keys make, he has said, but turns to the Olympia only once a paragraph he has worked on in his quadrille notebooks seems finished. He dislikes computers and thinks Amazon is “the enemy”. Each day, having worked for six hours on the new novel, he felt “depleted”: writing books is “exhausting, physically and mentally”. With Hustvedt, he would usually unwind by watching a classic film. According to Auster, “only a person who really felt compelled to do it would shut himself up in a room every day … When I think about the alternatives – how beautiful life can be, how interesting – I think it’s a crazy way to live your life.” Dwelling again on Trump and the state of America, he remarks that he has often been tormented by the question he puts into the mouth of Ferguson 4: “If the world is on fire”, what use are works of fiction? “When you have a social conscience, there is a great push and pull inside of you about how to spend your time” and he has “never really come up with an answer”. But there remains the “hunger to write”, he insists, “to keep doing it”, even if the good sentences refuse to come. The “excitement, the struggle, is emboldening and vivifying. I just feel more alive writing.” • 4321 is published by Faber on 31 January. To order a copy for £15 (RRP £20) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Is Kevin an astute observer of the game or a lazy bias journalist? His reasoning is based on Federer’s lack of match practice after last year’s injury problems. There would have been a feeling of inevitability about this one in the past – Berdych hasn’t beaten the Swiss since 2013, trails their head-to-head 16-6 and has lost their past five – but Federer has looked understandably rusty this week. Having slipped to 17th in the world as a result of his knee problems, this will give us a good indication of how Federer’s feeling. Berdych, the 10th seed, has the kind of power game that could expose any slow movement from Federer. Equally, however, Federer has the imagination to unbalance Berdych. It’s all to play for. The players are out on court.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5881e570e4b0f0efb00f61d3"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T10:25:11.713Z"">10.25am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>After a little wobble, Kei Nishikori is two sets up against Lukas Lacko.</strong> He leads 6-4, 6-4.</p>   </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2017-01-20T11:08:05.199Z"">at 11.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5881e45fe4b0f0efb00f61ca"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2017-01-20T10:21:26.962Z"">10.21am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Ashleigh Barty held the advantage in the third set on Rod Laver Arena, but Mona Barthel was undeterred. </strong>Trailing 3-2 , the German broke back and four straight games were enough to seal a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over the Australian.

While Novak Djokovic went out to Denis Istomin yesterday, Murray has just secured his place in the fourth round, where he will face Mischa Zverev after the unseeded German’s win over Malik Jaziri, after dealing with Querrey’s heavy serve to beat the American 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. Murray’s win means that Dan Evans and Bernard Tomic are out on Hisense Arena now.

The winner plays Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who’s beaten Jack Sock of the USA in four sets.</p> <p>Staying with Murray, though, he’s yet to drop a set this week and he’s looking good for another strong run in Melbourne, although one man he wouldn’t mind seeing removed his path is Stan Wawrinka, his potential semi-final opponent.

That took all of 90 minutes for Federer. “I always felt against better ranked players, you lift your game,” Federer says. “I didn’t expect it to go quite this hard. I had no expectations. In practice things were going well, but I’ve never been the practice king.” He’s still the king in other ways, though, and it promises to be a fascinating occasion when he faces Kei Nishikori in the fourth round on Sunday. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for reading. Bye. Federer whips a backhand pass beyond Berdych for 15-0, before a punchy forehand makes it 30-0. An ace down the middle brings up three match points. He squanders the first with a dismal backhand, but a beautiful backhand on the second wraps it up. That was an absurd performance from, er, the world No17. Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-4, 5-4 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych is taken to deuce, Federer attempting to get this done without having to serve for it, and a struggle ensues. But Berdych holds with an ace in the end. Federer will have to serve for it. He’s going to have stay on court for another two or three minutes! Third set: Federer* 6-2, 6-4, 5-3 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer holds to love and moves a game away from the fourth round. This is a masterclass. Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-4, 4-3 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych holds again, but the tension that was present on Rod Laver Arena at the start of this match has completely evaporated. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 6-4, 4-2 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer holds to love, another pearler of a backhand from left to night effortlessly doing the trick. Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-4, 3-2 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych hangs in there, holding to 15. At least he hasn’t given up. He could have been forgiven for booking his plane ticket home half an hour ago. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 6-4, 3-1 Berdych (*denotes server): Berdych gets to 30-all here. Federer responds with an ace and holds to 30 when he comes out on top at the net. Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-4, 2-1 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych holds, but there’s simply no covering up this wound. Third set: Federer* 6-2, 6-4, 2-0 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer easily consolidates the break. His world ranking is a bit misleading, isn’t it. If he’s the world’s 17th best tennis player, next you’ll be telling me they’re going to inaugurate Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America! Ha! Third set: Federer 6-2, 6-4, 1-0 Berdych* (*denotes server): Some fans are already giving Federer a standing ovation. One spectacular backhand down the line earns him a break point. Another one down the line is enough to confirm that he isn’t playing the same sport as Berdych. Serving for the second set, Federer reads a Berdych backhand pass and digs out a stupendous backhand volley at the net, polishing the point off with an overhead to lead 15-0. Some of his volleys have been ridiculous. It’s not long before he has two set points. He’s giving Berdych the runaround here. In attempting to decipher Federer’s game, Berdych looks like he’s been asked to solve climate change by the end of the day. Federer can’t take the first set point, but he converts the second when Berdych sends a return long off a second serve. Federer leads by two sets in under an hour. Second set: Federer 6-2, 5-4 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych holds and Federer will have to serve for the second set. It’s highly unlikely that Berdych will be coming back from two sets down, so he needs to come up with a salvage operation pretty quickly. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 5-3 Berdych (*denotes server): The Federer backhand is purring. So’s the forehand. So’s the serve. That spells doom for Berdych. Another love hold for Federer and he’s a game away from a two-set lead and a meeting with Kei Nishikori. Second set: Federer 6-2, 4-3 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych holds. He’s not out of this yet. But he has to work out a way to make an impact on Federer’s serve, else he will be soon. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 4-2 Berdych (*denotes server): Another straightforward hold for Federer. Berdych hasn’t been close to earning a break point yet. Second set: Federer 6-2, 3-2 Berdych* (*denotes server): At 30-15, Federer brilliantly flicks a backhand down the line, only for Berdych to stretch and win the point with a forehand volley. He stays in touch with an ace to hold. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 3-1 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer holds to 15 and Berdych isn’t laying a glove on a 35-year-old who’s barely played for six months. Second set: Federer 6-2, 2-1 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych holds to love with an ace, but it’s not enough to wipe the frown off his face. He knows he’s being embarrassed here. Second set: Federer* 6-2, 2-0 Berdych (*denotes server): More sublime tennis from Federer is enough for a routine hold. What is Berdych meant to do? Second set: Federer 6-2, 1-0 Berdych* (*denotes server): Berdych looks utterly clueless at the moment. He can’t hit through Federer, but his desperation to do so is leading to errors. Federer has two break points. He nets a forehand return on the first, but Berdych knocks a forehand wide on the second. Federer is in complete control, up a set and a break, and heading towards a fourth round match against Kei Nishikori, who’s just beaten Lukas Lacko in three sets. Serving for the set, Federer loses the first point when he nets a backhand volley. But Berdych misses a chance for 0-30, missing a forehand pass, and Federer quickly earns two set points with a stunning reactive volley at the net. He can’t take the first. No problem. Berdych nets a return and the first set is done in under half an hour. I’m calling it: Federer v Nadal in the final. First set: Federer 5-2 Berdych* (*denotes server): Federer is having fun, so everyone except Tomas Berdych is having fun. He feathers a drop shot over the net to make it 15-all, Berdych’s movement exposed again. Berdych gathers himself and moves to 40-15. A delicious half volley from Federer makes it 40-30, and the game goes to deuce after another error from Berdych. A rasping return from Federer earns him a break point, which effectively doubles up as a set point, and even his luck’s in at the moment. A backhand slice clips the top of the net and lands on Berdych’s side, with the Czech still loitering near the baseline and unable to reach the dropping ball. Federer will serve for the first set after 23 minutes. First set: Federer* 4-2 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer consolidates the break, holding to 30. Rod Laver is in the crowd today. He’ll approve of what he’s watching. First set: Federer 3-2 Berdych* (*denotes server): Federer is looking bright and positive, running round a forehand to clobber a clean one down the line for 0-15. He’s dominating quite a few of these rallies. He finds the line with another forehand and although Berdych lofts it back, Federer charges to the net to punch a volley away for 0-30. That’s his 10th winner. Berdych responds with his fourth, a crisp forehand making it 15-30, but Federer has two break points when the Czech nets a forehand. He only needs one. Federer’s pulling Berdych all over the pace here, as though he has him on a string, and a forehand pushes the Czech wide and forces him to net his riposte. The first break goes to Federer, who is suddenly, ominously, into his groove. First set: Federer* 2-2 Berdych (*denotes server): Federer breezes into a 40-0 lead, serving brilliantly, before wrongfooting Berdych with a forehand straight out of Mensa. First set: Federer 1-2 Berdych* (*denotes server): The two trade heavy blows from the baseline on the opening point and the rally ends with Federer cuffing a trademark backhand down the line for 0-15, a backhand so regal I assume it’s going to appear in an episode of the The Crown at some point. Berdych doesn’t look fazed in the presence of tennis royalty, though. A huge ace down the middle makes it 30-15; a forehand winner sees him hold to 15. First set: Federer* 1-1 Berdych (*denotes server): The crowd’s clearly on Federer’s side, cheering loudly when he wins the first point with an accurate serve down the middle, then when Berdych nets a forehand to make it 30-0. Two double-faults from Federer make it 30-all, but an ace makes it 40-30 and he holds with another solid serve. First set: Federer 0-1 Berdych* (*denotes server): Off we go, Tomas Berdych opening the serving in front of an excitable Rod Laver Arena. He wins the first three points easily, Federer shanking three backhands to make it 40-0, and Berdych holds to love with an ace. Tok! Tok! Tok! The players are knocking up. If Tomas Berdych needs any further encouragement, he should remember that he has pulled off two big wins over Roger Federer in the past, beating him at Wimbledon in 2010 and the US Open in 2012. Roger Federer and Tomas Berdych, then. Federer beat the Czech in straight sets here last year, but our tennis correspondent, Kevin Mitchell, has been telling me to put money on Berdych today. Is Kevin an astute observer of the game or a lazy bias journalist? His reasoning is based on Federer’s lack of match practice after last year’s injury problems. There would have been a feeling of inevitability about this one in the past – Berdych hasn’t beaten the Swiss since 2013, trails their head-to-head 16-6 and has lost their past five – but Federer has looked understandably rusty this week. Having slipped to 17th in the world as a result of his knee problems, this will give us a good indication of how Federer’s feeling. Berdych, the 10th seed, has the kind of power game that could expose any slow movement from Federer. Equally, however, Federer has the imagination to unbalance Berdych. It’s all to play for. The players are out on court. After a little wobble, Kei Nishikori is two sets up against Lukas Lacko. He leads 6-4, 6-4. Ashleigh Barty held the advantage in the third set on Rod Laver Arena, but Mona Barthel was undeterred. Trailing 3-2 , the German broke back and four straight games were enough to seal a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over the Australian. All of which means that Roger Federer and Tomas Berdych will be on court imminently. Lukas Lacko is still massively up against it on Margaret Court Arena, but the Slovakian is feeling better about life after breaking Kei Nishikori for the first time. Nishikori was serving for the second set at 5-2, but Lacko finally mustered some resistance. He still trails 6-4, 5-3, though. Here’s a report on Dan Evans’s victory over Bernard Tomic. Back comes Mona Barthel, though, breaking for 3-3 in the third set. Momentum is on the German’s side now. In better news for Australians, Ashleigh Barty is a break up in the third set against Mona Barthel. She leads 4-6, 6-3, 3-2. Facing four match points, Bernard Tomic decides he’s had quite enough of this nonsense and nets a forehand to pave the way for Dan Evans to roll into the fourth round. Evans clenches his fist and roars in celebration. He’s backed up that amazing win over Marin Cilic by beating the 27th seed in straight sets, showing signs of a more mature mentality and the ability to handle the intense demands of a grand slam. It’s about to get even tougher after this 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 win for Evans, though, because he’ll be playing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Sunday. Kei Nishikori is busily dismantling Lukas Lacko on Margaret Court Arena. After two breaks in the second set, the fifth seed leads 6-4, 3-0. Another tie-break on Hisense Arena. Here’s Adam Collins. Play has resumed. The roofs have not been shut. On we go. The debate between various officials at the moment is whether or not to close the roofs. The rain is pretty light at the moment. In a negative development, it’s starting to rain in Melbourne. Players are sitting down. There was just enough time on Rod Laver Arena for Ashleigh Barty takes the second set 6-3 against Mona Barthel. They’re going into a third. Neat and tidy from Kei Nishikori, who gives nothing away, takes his chances and wins the first set 6-4 against Lukas Lacko. The winner will face either Roger Federer or Tomas Berdych next. Those two are last on the card on Rod Laver Arena, where Australia’s Ashleigh Barty is currently serving to level her match against Mona Barthel. Kei Nishikori has been threatening to break on Margaret Court Arena and now he has. A few chances went begging early on, but the fifth seed leads 4-3 against Lukas Lacko. Mona Barthel isn’t endearing herself to the locals on Rod Laver Arena. She’s a set up against Australia’s Ashleigh Barty. Dan Evans is proving similarly unpopular on Hisense Arena. The fiery Brummie is two sets up against Bernard Tomic after dominating the tie-break. He leads 7-5, 7-6. On Margaret Court Arena, Kei Nishikori and Lukas Lacko are about to get going. Nishikori, the fifth seed, will surely be too skilful for the Slovakian. Dan Evans served for the second set against Bernard Tomic. He had set points. He got broken. Then he saved set points. Now it’s a tie-break. Mona Barthel has a grip on the first set on Rod Laver Arena. The German has the break against Ashleigh Barty and leads 4-3. It’s all over on Court 2. Alison Riske fought gamely in the second set, but Sorana Cirstea is a deserved 6-2, 7-6 winner. The Romanian will face either Garbine Muguruza or Anastasij Sevastova next. The evening session is underway on Rod Laver Arena. Roger Federer and Tomas Berdych will be on court later, but first it’s Australia’s Ashleigh Barty against Germany’s Mona Barthel. On her second match point, Venus Williams aims a backhand down the line and Ying-Ying Duan can only watch it fly by. This was barely a contest at all. Williams wins 6-1, 6-0 in a mere 58 minutes and the truth is that Duan resembled little more than a hitting partner for much of a painfully one-sided match. All she can take from it is that she didn’t suffer the ignominy of a double bagel, but that’s not saying much. Venus Williams is handing out a lesson on Margaret Court Arena, breaking to 15 to lead 6-1, 5-0. Ying-Ying Duan looks stunned. “Come on!” yelps Dan Evans. He’s just won the first set 7-5 against Bernard Tomic. Adam Collins has more. A break for Venus Williams in the first game of the second set and Ying-Ying Duan’s Australian Open is set to meet a grisly end. Unless she takes a leaf out of Alison Riske’s book. She was outplayed by Sorana Cirstea in the first set, but she’s coping well in the second. It’s 3-3 and there’s been a break apiece. Venus Williams barely had to get out of first gear to win the first set 6-1 against China’s Ying-Ying Duan. The 13th seed is cruising. Duan did well just to get on the scoreboard, but they don’t look like they belong on the same court at the moment. Ying-Ying Duan looks horribly outgunned against Venus Williams, who earns a break point in the fourth game when clips a forehand pass beyond her stranded Chinese opponent, who should have done so much better with a backhand at the net. Duan is breathing heavily already. A big return from Williams forces an error from Duan and that’s enough for a 4-0 lead. An upset looks unlikely here. Williams has the measure of Duan already. Dan Evans double-faults to drop serve. He batters a backhand down the line to break in the next game and lead Bernard Tomic 3-2. It’s all happening on Hisense Arena, neither man comfortable on serve yet. There have been three breaks in the first give games. Meanwhile Sorana Cirstea has taken the first set 6-2 against Alison Riske on Court 2. Kevin Mitchell’s report on Andy Murray’s win over Sam Querrey is here. Our main focus today will be on a mouthwatering match between Roger Federer and Tomas Berdych, but they won’t be on court for another two or three hours. In the meantime, we have Venus Williams to keep us entertained on Margaret Court Arena. The 13th seed is up against China’s unseeded Ying-Ying Duan. That match has just started. Elsewhere another American, Alison Riske, is having a tough time against Romania’s Sorana Cirstea. She trails 5-2 in the first set. But let’s move on to what’s happening right now and Dan Evans has made a lightning start on Hisense Arena, hammering his forehand down the line to break in the very first game against Bernard Tomic. Adam Collins has the latest. As for the women’s draw, it’s already been eventful today. Not so much for Angelique Kerber, mind you. The world No1 looked shaky in her opening two matches, but she was just getting into the swing of things judging by her 6-0, 6-4 win over Krystina Pliskova earlier. Kerber’s fourth round opponent will be Coco Vandeweghe, who stamped out the apparent Eugenie Bouchard revival, beating the Canadian 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. This is the first time that Vandeweghe has made it into the last 16. Two other matches have also already gone the distance today and they were won by Russians. Svetlana Kuznetsova, the eighth seed, beat Jelena Jankovic 6-4, 5-7, 9-7 in a contest that wasn’t for the faint-hearted, while Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the 24th seed, outlasted Elina Svitolina, the 11th seed. Kuznetsova and Pavlyuchenkova meet next. It is not unheard of for the world No1 to lose to Sam Querrey in the third round of a grand slam. Not Andy Murray, though. While Novak Djokovic went out to Denis Istomin yesterday, Murray has just secured his place in the fourth round, where he will face Mischa Zverev after the unseeded German’s win over Malik Jaziri, after dealing with Querrey’s heavy serve to beat the American 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. Murray’s win means that Dan Evans and Bernard Tomic are out on Hisense Arena now. You can follow that match with Adam Collins here. The winner plays Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who’s beaten Jack Sock of the USA in four sets. Staying with Murray, though, he’s yet to drop a set this week and he’s looking good for another strong run in Melbourne, although one man he wouldn’t mind seeing removed his path is Stan Wawrinka, his potential semi-final opponent. That was a distinct possibility when the former champion dropped the opening set of his match against Victor Troicki, but Wawrinka came back to beat the 29th seed in four sets. He plays Andreas Seppi next.",18330,Jacob Steinberg,NA,NA,NA,"<a href=""profile/jacob-steinberg"">Jacob Steinberg</a>",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
