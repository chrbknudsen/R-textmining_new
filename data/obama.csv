1,2009-01-20T19:16:38Z,News,"Obama inauguration: We will remake America, vows President Obama",America's first black president promises to roll back Bush years and restore nation's moral standing,"Barack Hussein Obama, the US president ushered in a new era of Democratic rule today with a promise to begin rolling back the Bush years and restore the nation's moral standing in the world. The 44th US president, speaking in front of the biggest inauguration crowd in US history, said: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America."" Well over a million people, wrapped up against the winter cold, many of them in place since dawn, filled the Mall to see Obama sworn in as the first black president. A big proportion of the crowd was African-American, many having travelled from across the continent to witness the historic moment. Large numbers also took the opportunity to celebrate the departure of President George Bush, who leaves office with some of the lowest popularity ratings in recent US history. He was jeered as he emerged from the Capitol building for the inauguration ceremony. There were cheers as a helicopter carrying him to retirement took off from Capitol Hill an hour later. Obama's speech was frequently inspirational, though he failed to find a phrase that is likely to resound down the generations, as did Roosevelt and Kennedy. Much of his oratory turned into an indictment of the outgoing president. He focused on Bush's abandonment of basic legal and human rights after the 9/11 attacks, rejecting as false the now former president's choice of security or American ideals. One of his first acts will be to order the closure of the Guantánamo detention centre. Heralding his new administration as ""an era of responsibility"", he set out a New Deal-style programme to tackle the recession by building roads and bridges, electric grids and digital lines. His administration would also confront the country's failed education and health systems, restore science to its rightful place, and make environmental concerns a priority. In a passage that produced one of the biggest cheers of the day, he promised to engage with the world in a way that Bush had failed to. He had a message for people and governments around the world watching the inauguration: ""We are ready to lead once more."" He specifically mentioned reaching out to the Muslim world. Hinting at his willingness to engage with countries such as Iran and Syria, though he did not name them, he said: ""We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."" Obama, son of a white mother from Kansas and a black father from Kenya, throughout the election campaign tried to avoid making too much of the fact that he would become the first African-American president. But he could not disappoint those who had been born in the days of segregation and had travelled long distances to be present today. Knowing it was a special moment for those and other black Americans, he said what American liberty meant was that ""a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Obama began the day with a visit to St John's church, across the square from the White House and the traditional venue for presidents, before heading for coffee with the Bushes. The outgoing vice-president, Dick Cheney, did not turn up at the door to join in the greeting. He is in a wheelchair, apparently because he injured his back while removing boxes. Obama and Bush then left to travel in an armoured car to the Capitol for the inauguration ceremony. Joe Biden was first sworn in as vice-president. Then came the moment for Obama. He initially stumbled over his words as Chief Justice John Roberts began the oath-taking. With the new first lady, Michelle, holding the Bible, the same one used for the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, he smiled and then began again. Obama was sworn in at 12.05pm with Roberts appearing to take the blame for the glitch, apparently caused when he asked Obama to recite the historic words in slightly the wrong order. One of the few sad notes on a day of celebration was that Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, attending a post-inaugural lunch for Obama on Capitol Hill, had to be rushed to hospital. Kennedy has been fighting brain cancer. Obama said, ""Our prayers are with his family."" Elderly West Virginia senator Robert Byrd was also taken ill at the lunch. Security in the capital was much higher than for Bush's inauguration four years ago. There were 28,000 secret service agents, police and US national guard members on duty, about 50% more than last time."
2,2009-01-20T22:00:00Z,Opinion,Obama from outer space,"Whether tweeting-heads on Twitter or CNN's satellite, inauguration media coverage stretched both technology and credulity","Well before it all began at noon, as the stage filled up with dignitaries and the Mall filled up with cheering people, the rolling news channels were already vying for the love of the viewing audience waiting to see the 44th US president sworn into office. Fox News quickly established heavyweight political commentary on the whole proceeding, as well as fashion-forward commentary on the outfits of Malia and Sasha Obama: ""They look like little ladies, don't they? In their long … um … coats?"" wondered one weighty commenter, grasping for the correct drapery term for the garments. ""Yep, coats"" confirmed his sidekick. And admiring the academic qualifications of the new first lady: ""I am going to officially proclaim … Um … and this is just one man's view … that Michelle Obama looks stunning. Yep. She really looks after herself."" CNN were meanwhile promising something almost as new-media ground-shaking as their election night hologram - itself hailed the world over as the world's most pointless rolling news gimmick. ""We can exclusively reveal,"" said Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, breathlessly and repeatedly, ""We have commissioned a satellite picture of the oathswearing - so we can see how the inauguration would be viewed from SPACE!"". And then promised to bring it to us as soon as they could. We moved to the edge of our seats. And in the meantime, while waiting for the extra-terrestrial view, we flicked around and watched the serious news anchors celebrity-spotting on stage. ""There's Aretha Franklin - the 'first lady of soul' - there are three first ladies on this stage: Aretha Franklin's the first Lady of Soul"" - proving that there's nothing that can kill a witty comment as fast as repeating it on CNN just in case anyone didn't catch how witty it was the first time around. And very occasionally, a small, human touch: shots of a moving van outside the East door of the White House. CNN managed to catch it when there were people beetling around the back of it. Fox, by the time they cut back, only got a van. ""And the Bushes are moving their clothes and their tchotchkes (an American term for knick-knacks, basically). Those sitting at home with the captions on had the added bonus of seeing a confused subtitler describe the Bushes as having to move out their 'Trotskys', which might have changed the place of Bush in history, if it were true. It wasn't. On Twitter, messages marked with a ""#current"" were received and sorted by Al Gore's TV channel before being put up in a common people's commentary on the ceremony. ""Cheney's transition into Dr Strangelove is complete,"" Someone tweeted, as the outgoing VP was wheeled onto the stage, due to back problems (from either moving boxes or bending over the shredder, opinion was divided on the cause depending on who you were) Other messages were bounding with purest excitement. ""Yes. We. DID!"" came several, as the president-elect walked onto the stage. ""I've got 4 vid streams running, and it's still not enough"" said another. Topping them all was a Twitterer called TymJones: ""I've gotten older, and the joy of Christmas morning has started to fade. THIS MOMENT HAS BROUGHT IT BACK! I'm so happy!!!!!!!!"" - although we can only assume in a ""childlike joy"" way rather than a celebration of the coming-of-the-messiah way. Twitter, liveblogs and television commentary alike questioned the naming convention as ""George Walker Bush"" was welcomed on stage, followed sometime after by: ""Ladies and gentlemen: Barack H Obama!"" H? So much for claiming back the name Hussain for universal use, they all said: Hussains all over the world must have felt their shoulders sag a little at the copping out (though they might have cheered up 20 minutes later when his full name was used in the oath) And then cross-cultural misunderstandings abounded on worldwide multimedia when Aretha Franklin stood up to sing God Save The Queen, but got the words wrong. (Sorry - it's the conventional British joke that must always be made upon hearing My Country 'Tis Of Thee.) She did it, though, in inimitable Aretha fashion, 66-years-old, with a full gospel choir singing 'Ringringringringring!"" at appropriate moments behind her. ""I hope the hat at least gets to sing a verse"" someone tweeted. And it could have, at that - in fact the bow atop it should have had a hat all its own. As the crowd hushed to listen to four world-class musicians play a new piece by John ""That guy who wrote the theme from Star Wars"" Williams, the news anchors, scared of silence - or, worse still, allowing people to listen to the music and somehow involve themselves in the ceremony - talked in short punchy clichés over the music. Part way through, at 12 noon precisely, a big sign flashed up on CNN: ""FACT: Barack Obama became president: the constitution states his term begins at noon even without oath"" Man, someone always has to try and call it first, don't they? As the oath was taken, people rejoiced in their own individual ways in various streams on twitter: ""I couldn't feel more inspired to put both feet squarely into adulthood."" was one ""Ah the end of an error [sic]. I feel a dark shadow has lifted off the capitol. Oh wait, that's because Cheney is sitting down."" The speech started. Certain tweeting celebrities (and many others) cheered the references to the importance of science and the existence of atheists. Others cheered in general, or merely followed their own agenda: ""Best President since Martin Sheen?"" - said another. ""I hope this is over in time for me to catch All My Children,"" said one more person joining wholeheartedly in the passage of history. And this is where the internet comes into its own - in the ability to pay listen out for your own area of interest, large or small, and feel free to give your opinion on exactly how correct (or not) that was. ""I am offended as a libertarian … I am sorry, but the question IS whether government is too big!"" said one CurrentTV twitterer, determined not to let the excitement of the day stand in the way of maintaining a healthy debate on personal crusades. During the speech, the swichover of the White House website to a new shiny web 2.0 special, blogs, galleries and all, caused a ripple of excitement among online communities, though most put off having a proper look until after the speech itself was over. And, when it was - during the poem reading that proved once more through polite applause and puzzled internet commentary that people don't really like Official National Poetry that much (apart from a few pleased and dissenting voices: ""Inaugural poem - 'We encounter each other in words.' So true for us here on twitter,"" said one) - the net came to life with reaction, debate, and people seeking to capture their moment. Flickr was busy creating an open pool of people at, watching, and giving their reaction to the Inauguration. A tag cloud created by one flickr user of Obama's speech, highlighting the words that were used most often - New; Nation; World; Common. It said. An hour after the oaths and the speechifying had finished, we sat and patiently waited for that promised satellite image. If they were saving it up this long, we reckoned, it must be something special. ""It's going to be"" said Wolf, once more ""REALLY cool."" The new president sat down to an inaugural lunch with congress. ""The recipe page for today's lunch has been the most visited of the whole inauguration site!"" said Senator Diane Feinstein, intriguingly, in her introduction. And all the while, as the cameras left congress to a private lunch, the livebloggers on their webpages, the twitterers in their own little worlds, the anchors chuntered away in the studios: There goes President Bush's plane, they said. Here are the crowds lining the route of the parade yet to come. And … ""We're told there was some cloud cover, but you just wait - it's going to be VERY COOL"" said Wolf Blitzen, yet again, sounding like he was trying hard to reassure someone - though whether it was us or himself was hard to decide. Lunch ended, chilly crowds said happy things, bundled up in warm … coats? (Yep, coats!) behind barriers lining the roads, preparing for the motorcade. At home and in offices, people turned over their televisions in time for those soaps, and let the live streaming coverage from Washington fall back among the work-filled windows on their computer screen. But those who trust in Wolf sat, and waited, bottoms sore from perching so close to the edge of their chairs: because we weren't moving anywhere until we'd seen this thing From Outer Space. Because even though it was over two hours ago - and even though we'd seen it from every considerable angle already, and even though there was all that cloud cover he'd been told about: it was, we still believed, going to be COOL. [Update, three hours after the ceremony: Still waiting.] [Five hours later: satellite image spotted! It is like google maps but with extra added ants. Brilliant. Glad we waited. Can I go to the toilet now?]"

5,2009-01-20T16:07:44Z,News,Inaugural address of President Barack Obama,Remarks as prepared for delivery by the 44th president of the United States,"My fellow citizens: I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition. Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans. That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet. These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights. Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America - they will be met. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness. In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted - for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labour, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act - not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise healthcare's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do. Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works - whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account - to spend wisely, reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day - because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favours only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart - not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good. As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our founding fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more. Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort - even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace. To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west - know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it. As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honour them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment - a moment that will define a generation - it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all. For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate. Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends - hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism - these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our confidence - the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny. This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: ""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."" America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations."
6,2009-01-20T13:56:40Z,News,Liveblogging the inauguration of Barack Obama,A minute-by-minute dispatch,"10am (all times eastern): So much has been said and written about the significance of this moment. But now, finally -- hard though it is to believe -- here it is. At around 11.30am today, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American to hold the office. (A little after 12.30, he'll escort George Bush to a waiting helicopter; might we assume there will be cheering?) The atmosphere in Washington DC this morning, where millions of people are gathering to share the moment, is electric: inaugurations are always quasi-religious affairs, but never in living memory has one been as freighted with meaning as this. The day's full schedule is here; the Obamas have just arrived at the White House, where they're joining the Bushes and the achy-backed Dick Cheney and his wife for coffee, before proceeding to the capitol. Join me here imminently for history in the making, plus wisecracks. 10.05am: Here's how big the crowd is: the entire stretch of the Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol has now reportedly been closed. See the satellite image here for what a vast stretch of space that is: it's fourteen long city blocks, or more than a mile. 10.11am: Bringing an official start to proceedings, we're now listening to the US Marine Band. I feel sorry for the flautists and the clarinettists, who have to wear fingerless gloves so that they can use their instruments. The bass drum guy has it so easy by comparison. 10.18am: Senior diplomatic and military types arrive to take their VIP seats on the Capitol steps. Nope, I've no idea who most of them are. Magic Johnson did arrive a little earlier, though. Everyone already looks very, very cold, and they've got plenty of time left to sit there getting colder. (Smugly, I've come back into the warmth -- it's the only way to follow the proceedings up close and to liveblog this thing -- but I was there just before and let me tell you it was freezing.) 10.26am: Ben Smith notes the audacity of French socialist politician Segolene Royal, who this morning claims credit for having inspired Obama. His team copied hers, she explains (except for the bit about winning). 10.33am: While we're waiting... an amusing inaugural fact from 1829, when another ""people's president"", Andrew Jackson, tried to hold an ""open"" inauguration, albeit on a different scale to today's. ""About 20,000 people trample mud and horse manure into the White House, destroy rugs, break satin-covered chairs, smash crystal and china, and spill liquor. Fights break out, women faint and Jackson has to escape through a window. Order is restored when barrels of whiskey are placed on the South Lawn, drawing the crowd outside."" Back in 2009, senior congressional leaders are arriving on the steps. 10.37am: At the White House, the Obamas and the Bushes are finishing up their coffee -- what wouldn't you give to be a fly on the wall at that particular meeting? -- and any moment they'll enter two limousines, the men in one and the women in another, the departing president sitting on the right, the president-elect on the left. It's not a long journey from the White House to the Capitol, even when the roads aren't cleared and empty for you, so we'll expect to see them arrive minutes later. 10.40am: Many great comments below -- do read them. Ted Kennedy arrives, thereby answering the question of whether he'd be well enough to attend. John Kerry and George HW Bush follow on; it's a dignitary bonanza up there! 10.43am: Jill Biden and Lynn Cheney leave the White House and step into a waiting limo, followed by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. ... And Joe Biden and, in a wheelchair, Dick Cheney, who injured his back yesterday moving into his new home. 10.48am: Two significant moments, almost simultaneous: at one end of the city, at the Capitol, John McCain arrives to watch the man who defeated him get sworn in, and at the other, Obama and Bush step out to the north portico of the White House to loud cheers. (Who knew Bush was so well-loved?) 10.53am: What must it be like to be Bush today, and to look down the Mall, as he will a little later, and see millions of people clamouring not only in support of your successor, but also for you to leave? I suspect Bush may be as relieved as anyone that he's leaving power today, but the man's internal life continues to baffle and fascinate. I don't mean to sound sympathetic, but... 10.59am: How they're welcoming Obama in Puri, India: a three-tonne sand sculpture. 11.05am: It's amusing, and rather touching, to see how many of the bigshot senators and other political figures are clutching digital cameras, snapping away, recording the moment. 11.08am: My colleague Richard Adams, who nabbed himself a good seat for today's events, and who is a show-off, texts to say he just ran into Al Franken on the way to the bathroom, but that Franken was too busy to stop to have his photograph taken. He's doubtless using every last minute to raise funds for his Minnesota court case. Meanwhile, Al and Tipper Gore arrive. [UPDATE: I misread Richard's text. This happened to someone sitting near him, not to him...] 11.17am: The Carters arrive... and the Clintons. And then someone really important, Rahm Emanuel, who will basically be the second most powerful person in the world within the hour. Meanwhile we learn that, following tradition, Bush left Obama a note in the White House. ""The White House today declined to provide intimate details of the message the two-term Republican left for the incoming Democrat, saying only that Bush wrote it on Monday and left it in the top drawer of his desk."" Your guesses? 11.20am: Chaos on the DC metro as a woman falls from a platform onto the track, closing two major stations. (They've now reopened.) At the White House, currently unoccupied by any president, moving crews are unloading boxes of Obama's stuff -- it's a lightning-fast operation. 11.25am: Here are Sasha and Malia Obama, in blue and pink winter coats respectively, and a roar carries down the Mall -- first, the people who are close by, then those watching on screens a long way away. 11.31am: Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are in their seats. And now here's Bush arriving at the Capitol, looking oddly apprehensive. ""No more Bush! No more Bush!"" chant the crowd, though they haven't seen Bush on the jumbotron screens yet, I don't think. 11.37am: ...Aaaand Bush and Cheney are announced to a military fanfare, accompanied by congressional leaders, and now a rendition of Hail To The Chief. Up on the Capitol steps, it's all smiles and polite applause, of course. Not so up by the Washington Monument, I'll warrant. 11.39am: Biden is announced, to raucous flagwaving. Backstage, there's footage of Obama walking through the Capitol building, looking even more completely sober and calm than usual, which is saying something. Though on second thoughts, maybe there's something in the cast of his expression this morning that speaks of the pressure he's under. He seems to be holding himself in. Any moment now, he'll walk into the cold open air. 11.43am: ""Ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect of the United States, Barack H. Obama."" The Mall explodes. For a moment on the carpeted staircase, Obama looks very slight, small, and solitary. But it only lasts a moment; now he's back in his element, shaking hands and taking his seat. 11.45am: Dianne Feinstein takes to the podium for her call to order. ""The world is watching today as our great democracy engages in this peaceful transition of power... we gather to etch another line in the solid stone of history. The freedom of a people to choose its leaders is the root of liberty. In a world where political strife is too often settled with violence, we come here every four years to bestow the power of the presidency upon our democratically elected leader... Future generations will mark this morning as the turning-point for real and necessary change in our nation. They will look back and remember that this is the moment when the dream that once echoed across history from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial finally reached the walls of the White House."" 11.48am: Here's the controverial evangelical pastor Rick Warren to provide the invocation. The invocation won't be controversial, you can be sure, though. Eyes are closed up and down the Mall. (Obama's too.) ""We celebrate a hinge point of history, with the inauguration of our first African-American president of the United States. We are so grateful to live in this land... where the son of an African immigrant can rise to the highest levels of our leadership."" Dr King is ""shouting in heaven"" he says. ""Help us to remember that we are Americans related not by religion or race or blood but by our commitment to freedom and justice for all... We now commit our new president and his wife Michelle, and his daughters Malia and Sasha, into your loving care."" He concludes with the Lord's Prayer. 11.53am: They're going to have to get through the rest of the ceremony pretty fast: Biden has to be sworn in first, but in accordance with the constitution, Obama has to take the oath by noon at the latest. We're running a good 20-25 minutes late compared to the official announced schedule. 11.54am: And yet first here's Aretha Franklin, approaching the podium to sing My Country Tis Of Thee, accompanied by the marine band. Which is, of course, our own beloved British national anthem. Only with different words. And, you know, better, when Aretha's singing it. 11.57am: Supreme court justice John Paul Stevens is introduced, to administer Biden's oath of office. Biden lays his hand on the bible. The oath: ""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."" And thus America has a new vice-president. Biden does a little arms-wide ""how about that then?"" gesture; Bruce Springsteen chuckles. (Bruce Springsteen's chuckle is not a consitutional requirement.) 12 noon: It's noon, so I guess that means Robert Gates is president for a few minutes? (UPDATE: No, it turns out. Bush is still president, Biden is vice-president. How weird is that? UPDATE II: Confusion reigns. Apparently it's Biden. Or maybe not.) The star-studded quartet of Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gabriela Montero and Anthony McGill are introduced. They're playing a selection of music arranged by John Williams, which lends an appropriately cinematic tenor to proceedings. (It's based around the Shaker song Simple Gifts.) 12.04pm: And here's Obama, with Chief Justice John Roberts. Obama uses his full name, of course, as protocol dictates, but it's still somewhat extraordinary to remember that America just elected someone with the middle name Hussein. He stumbles slightly over the oath, actually, though it seemed that it was Roberts who stumbled first... but they get through it. And so here we are. You can imagine the scenes on the Mall. 12.07pm: Obama takes the podium. ""Thank you, thank you... My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors."" Forty-four people have taken the oath, he says, but ""every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms... That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood"": war, economic crisis. ""And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."" 12.11pm: ""Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: they will be met."" 12.13pm: He praises ""the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things... time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions."" America is still the most prosperous nation on earth, he says, its minds no less inventive, ""our capacity... undiminished... But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions: that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."" 12.16pm: A pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place,"" and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Now he's rejecting the notion that this isn't a time for grand ambitions. ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them: the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply."" The question isn't big or small government, but whether government works; not whether the free market is good or bad but that it needs a ""watchful eye."" ""As for our common defence, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" 12.18pm: ""And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more..."" America will ""begin responsibly to leave Iraq to its people"" and start to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet... [but] we will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you,"" because America's ""patchwork heritage"" is a strength, not a weakness. Pretty aggressive stuff. He mentions Americans' various religions, and also ""non-believers"": a first for an inaugural address? That's impressive. 12.21pm: ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West: know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."" We can no longer afford to ignore ""suffering outside our borders,"" he says. ""Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect."" And more about the international community: a real internationalist focus here, which as a non-American I can't help finding some of the most rousing stuff. (I take the commentators' point, though, that Euroliberals would probably have condemned some of Obama's words on spreading the American ideal abroad if it had been uttered by George Bush as, indeed, it was, in his 2004 inaugural...) The sense of being somewhat stressed that was evident on Obama's face a little earlier has vanished; at this podium, it seems, is where he feels most at home. 12.24pm: And now the much-anticipated passage on personal responsibility. The whole speech, indeed, is notable for how much focus Obama's putting on seeking to buck Americans up, to stiffen their spines, to call them to action. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility: a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship... This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed... and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" Huge, huge applause. 12.26pm: Building to a finale now, remembering George Washington's words in the harsh winter of 1776. ""In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America."" 12.28pm: A long poem now by Elizabeth Alexander. (I'll let others dissect it later.) The civil rights leader Reverend Joseph Lowery is here to deliver the benediction. (Only a few minutes until the Bush Helicopter Moment now!) ""Mend our brokenness, heal our wounds, and delivery us from the exploitation of the poor,"" Lowery asks God. ""...We walk together, pledging that we won't get weary in the difficult days ahead."" And then a rather unexpected rhyming riff about racial diversity and co-operation, which I missed and will post here as soon as I get hold of a copy. UPDATE: Here it is. Lowery called for the day ""when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white would embrace what is right."" So there. 12.39pm: The national anthem concludes this part of the proceedings, with hundreds of thousands on the Mall joining in -- although quite a few left immediately after the swearing-in, doubtless to avoid the crush. Bush and Obama move through the crowd together now. The helicopter awaits. The crowd on the Mall: are they ecstatic? Yes, they are ecstatic. 12.47pm: Obama and ""the former president Bush"" -- there are two of them, now! -- enter the Capitol building. They'll walk through it to the east side, where Marines line the staircase and a helicopter waits in the courtyard. The helicopter is Executive One; it's only Marine One when the president is inside it. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 12.50pm: The Obamas and Bushes emerge onto the steps and pose for photographs. I've got to say, Bush looks positively glowing now that it's all over. They're exchanging what looks like small talk. (What could it be?) 12.52pm: A positively jovial mood seems to prevail between the two men as they walk towards the helicopter flanked by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush. A pat on the shoulder from Obama to Bush, words between George and Michelle, and then a final handshake between 43 and 44. The helicopter's staircases swing up and closed, leaving the Obamas and the Bidens on the east Capitol steps. The helicopter rotors start turning, blowing Michelle Obama's hair. 12.56pm: And Bush goes up and away; the helicopter grows small. There is, as you might imagine, quite a bit of cheering from the crowds on the Mall. Apparently the helicopter may go on a bit of scenic tour of DC, but it's headed ultimately to Andrews Air Force Base, whereupon the Bushes will board a plane for Texas. ""Na na na na, hey hey, goodbye,"" sing the spectators on the Mall. 1pm: The new president has to sign numerous official documents now, and then he'll have a private lunch with Congressional leaders. This liveblog will get a bit more sporadic for a while now; I might get some lunch too, though not with Congressional leaders, I fear. Thanks for all your comments so far. 2.07pm: I had a chicken sandwich. Obama ate food from Lincoln's era, although not technically one hopes. The menu is here. Pheasant, duck, sour cherry chutney and molassses sweet potatoes, followed by apple cinnamon sponge cake. 2.41pm: They're still eating; Nancy Pelosi is addressing the diners. The crowds lining the parade route remain excitable. The inaugural parade is, well, a parade. The one genuinely intriguing question is whether, when, and for how long Obama will get out of his limousine and walk for part of the route along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Carter was the first president to walk the entire route, but security concerns mean that if Obama walks it'll almost certainly be just for a small portion of it. 2.51pm: ""Medical emergency reported at Congressional luncheon,"" MSNBC reports Ted Kennedy has been taken out of the luncheon on a stretcher. Obama is speaking to the diners now, and begins his remarks with words of praise for the Massachusetts senator. UPDATE: And 91-year-old Robert Byrd, who was ""removed in his wheelchair under the supervision of medical personnel."" UPDATE II: Byrd's going to be OK, apparently, and the reports on Kennedy seem broadly upbeat, too. 3.20pm: And the parade begins. The Obamas and the Bidens, looking exceptionally cold on the Capitol steps -- Michelle looks positively exhausted -- stand for a military march-past. There are many tubas. 3.24pm: The first couple enter the Beast, the president's extraordinarily well-protected limousine, license plate USA1. Obama seems a little awkward saluting the various military personnel lining the route. The motorcade progresses at walking pace out of the Capitol grounds. 3.36pm: The limousine reaches the parade route, with tens of motorcycles, blue and red lights flashing, in the lead. The crowds lining the route -- only five or six deep at this point, because access is restricted -- whoop and scream. 4.03pm: Finally, as the motorcade reaches the Navy Memorial, the limousine slows to a halt -- not that it was going fast in the first place -- and the Obamas get out, several blocks earlier than planned, apparently. They're striding purposefully up Pennsylvania Avenue now, flanked by Secret Service personnel, waving at the onlookers. (We're running so far behind schedule now that the light is beginning to fade.) They're walking significantly faster than the car was travelling, by my reckoning. This administration can't be seen to be taking things easy. 4.11pm: And back into The Beast. 4.15pm: The motorcade approaches the White House, where the Obamas will take their positions in a heavily bulletproofed viewing stand to watch the passing parade. I'm going to wrap this up now, but if you've got access to TV coverage, you've got plenty of parading left to watch, should you so choose. What a day; what a moment to have witnessed. Thank you for reading and commenting. More post-inauguration blogging from me here tomorrow."
7,2009-01-20T19:11:29Z,News,Obama inauguration: President delivers wintry performance,"• Perlman, McGill, Montero and Ma play Williams arrangement• Bleak weather a recurring theme of Obama speech","Pulling together a classical ensemble that might conceivably represent what Obama would call ""our patchwork heritage"" is no easy task in the white-dominated world of classical music, but it was done. Here was a perfectly politically correct chamber group to usher in the inaugural address: African-American Anthony McGill played the clarinet; French-born Chinese-American Yo-Yo Ma took the cello part; and Itzhak Perlman, born in Tel Aviv, was the violinist. At the piano was Gabriela Montero, who lives in the US, but is a celebrity in her native Venezuela. The music? Air and Simple Gifts by John Williams, the composer of a myriad film scores from Star Wars to Schindler's List. The work is based on the same humble Shaker hymn that Copland quoted in his ballet Appalachian Spring, a melody so American as to be almost a cliche. The sweet and yearning strains of Williams's piece was an apt introduction to the president's address. As a performer, Obama has in the past done rousing and energetically inspiring; he has kicked back and become the cheery anecdotalist and joker. But even in his speech on race relations in Philadelphia this March, he did not take a tone so sombre and sober as to compare with the almost funereal delivery of his inaugural speech. The president barely smiled - he had kept his expression darkly checked as he emerged into the light of the Capitol steps – and his deep seriousness was somewhat at odds with the flamboyance of the costume department, which had tricked out the women of his family in a rainbow of pink and orange, of fuchsia and blue, and of glimmering lime. Obama's performance was more suitably matched with George Bush's costume of the day – a black overcoat mournfully matched with a black scarf. The most striking recurring imagery of the speech – which was always going to be a finely wrought literary creation – was of bleak weather. Obama talked of ""gathering clouds and raging storms"", of ""icy currents"", of ""snow stained with blood"", and used a near-Shakespeare quote, ""winter of our hardship"". His delivery was wintry, too – there was none of the rabble-rousing, preacher-man effervescence that he can summon up on occasion. Nor, significantly, did he spill out lines (such as his famous ""Yes we can"") that demanded an audience's vocal response; or deal in self-consciously memorable soundbites (there was no equivalent here of Kennedy's ""ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country""). It was time to set aside childish things, he said, and this was a grown-up piece of speaking, consciously recalling Roosevelt's inaugural address, and designed to apotheosise him from folksy people's friend to tough leader of men – and the delivery of which was at its most animated and arresting when he promised America's enemies: ""You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."" In short, a performance virtuosic in its magisterial gloom."
8,2009-01-20T19:42:06Z,News,Obama inauguration: Themes of the inaugural address,• Renunciation of George Bush key to Barack Obama's address• Speech touches on environment and end to plutocracy,"Renunciation of the Bush era Nowhere was Barack Obama's inaugural address more outspoken or heartfelt than in the condemnation of the presidency that had come to an end moments earlier. The Bush epoque was ""our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions"". He presented it as a detour from America's destiny, and he repeatedly invoked the need to return to American ideals stretching back to the country's most celebrated founding father and first president, George Washington. In other words, as Obama has said before, it was time for America to reboot. Early in the speech, he briskly ran through a catalogue of failure: ""Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many"" while America's energy policies, ""strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet"". In a withering farewell to the age, he quoted Corinthians - ""the time has come to set aside childish things"". A ""new era of responsibility"" and an end to plutocracy To put an end to this age of fecklessness, Obama's emphasis was on the need for shared sacrifice. It was intended as a counterpoint to one of the most criticised aspects of the Bush presidency - that it called for huge sacrifices from the nation's servicemen, but not from its civilians and especially not for its rich, who benefited from extraordinary tax cuts. Obama warned that Americans would have to recognise ""that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world."" In place of ""those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame"" - the people Bush once jokingly referred to as ""his base"" - the new president looked for inspiration to the unknown Americans ""obscure in their labour"", who had fought and worked ""till their hands were raw"". Noting that ""a nation cannot prosper long when it favours only the prosperous"", Obama in effect called for an end to plutocracy. It was as close to class rhetoric as an American president ever comes. A green new deal In an echo of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural, Obama said it was not the nation that had failed. The crisis was a consequence of failure of leadership, and the ""greed and irresponsibility"" of a few. The answer was to get back to work, with the government in the lead. It was a 21st Century version of FDR's New Deal, with a pledge that when the country rebuilt, it would rebuild in a sustainable way. ""We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together,"" Obama said. ""We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."" Science would be ""restored to its rightful place. A return to soft power One of the few times the rhythm of the speech was broken by spontaneous applause was when Obama rejected what he portrayed as a false choice ""between our safety and our ideals"". The short phrase encapsulated a deep-seated unease that, in striking out against its enemies, America had lost its way, stumbled into Guantanamo Bay and ""black"" CIA detention sites, and abdicated its claim to moral leadership. Obama promised the rest of the world ""we are ready to lead once more"". What had won previous great struggles had been ""sturdy alliances and enduring convictions"" not ""power alone"". Americans could not ""do as we please"", but had to rely more on soft power - ""the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humilty and restraint"", and addressing the Muslim world in particular, he offered a ""new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect"". Pragmatism above all Time and again, Obama made clear his intention was not to lurch from one deeply ideological administration to another. Pragmatism would the watchword in the White House. Government programs would be pursued when they worked, axed when they did not. Market forces were neither good nor bad. They could generate wealth but had to be kept under a ""watchful eye"". Similarly foreign policy would be geared to the realities of the outside world. Even despots could be forgiven, knowing that America ""will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist""."
9,2009-01-20T19:05:11Z,News,Obama women give inauguration ensembles modern twist,"Orange and pink is the new red, white and blue","Michelle Obama got dressed today knowing that every thread of the outfit she picked for the moment she became first lady would be forensically inspected for meaning. Her choice was a dress and coat in Swiss wool lace, lined in French silk, designed by a Cuban-American fashion designer, Isabel Toledo, and made by a team of Chinese, Polish and Spanish seamstresses in Toledo's New York studio. As the images were beamed around the world, the colour was being described by many commentators as gold, with all the regal connotations of that colour; the New York Times, however, judged it to be the rather more subtle and sophisticated shade of lemon grass. Toledo herself, who only knew for sure that her outfit had made the cut when she saw it on CNN today, described it as an ""optimistic"" colour, that ""had sunshine"". The bold choices that characterised her campaign wardrobe made Michelle Obama a fashion icon even before the election. Today was her first attempt to blend her own, very modern image with the venerated position of first lady. Stung, perhaps, by the lukewarm reception to the daring black-and-red dress she wore on election night (one wit described that as ""an apron designed by Mark Rothko"") she seemed to lean a little too heavily on recent precedent today. In her richly textured lace, and abiding by a now old-fashioned convention of a matching dress and coat, Obama appeared to be ""channelling"" the stately look favoured by Barbara and Laura Bush on state occasions, rather than the sleek, pared down image of Jackie Kennedy, to whom she has often been compared. What lifted the outfit were the accessories: sleek leather gloves (which she used to hold the Bible during her husband's swearing in) and Jimmy Choo pumps in a smartly offbeat shade of olive. From a fashion-watcher's perspective, it was Malia and Sasha Obama who stole the show today. Not even Aretha Franklin's spectacular hat could compete with a virtuoso display of on-trend colour-blocking by the first daughters, in their contrasting coats and scarves. Malia, 10, looked terrific in electric blue and black while Sasha, 7, hit it out of the park in this season's hot orange-and-pink colour combination. You heard it here first: orange and pink is the new red, white and blue."
10,2009-01-20T18:07:00Z,News,President Obama calls for remaking of America,Millions brave freezing temperatures in Washington for historic inauguration ceremony,"Barack Obama, the first African-American to be elected to the White House, today called for a ""new era of responsibility"" as he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States. In front of a crowd of more than 1 million people, Obama acknowledged in his inauguration speech that times were fraught, with the US fighting two wars and grappling with the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. ""That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood,"" he told a crowd that stretched out for miles before him. ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. ""Our economy is badly weakened – a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age."" But the 47-year-old said he was ready to meet the challenges confronting the US: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."" Obama went on to say that the US ""will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan"". While not mentioning al-Qaida by name, he had hard words for America's enemies. ""We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence,"" the new US president said. ""And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."" In an indictment of the Bush era, he also called for a return to traditional values of hard work and honesty. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility – a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world ..."" The handover to a new US administration began its ritual unfolding when Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived at the White House to be met by George and Laura Bush on a red carpet. The four posed for the cameras after Michelle, wearing a pale gold sheath dress with matching coat by the Cuban-born American designer Isabel Toledo, handed a giftwrapped box to the Bushes. After the traditional short pre-inauguation coffee, the incoming and outgoing presidential entourages made their way in their armoured motorcades to the ceremony. The soul music legend Aretha Franklin kicked off proceedings by singing Let Freedom Ring, watched by the Washington elite and Hollywood celebrities including Dustin Hoffman, Stephen Spielberg and John Cusack. As Bush arrived at the Capitol, a smattering of boos could be heard. Dick Cheney, Bush's vice-president, who had pulled a muscle in his back, attended the ceremony in a wheelchair. Bush later left the White House by helicopter for the last time. In keeping with tradition, Bush had left a note for Obama in the top drawer of his desk in the Oval Office. Dana Perino, the former White House press secretary, said it wished Obama well in beginning a ""fabulous new chapter"" in the US. Planners expected attendance easily to top the 1.2 million people who attended Lyndon Johnson's 1965 inauguration, the largest crowd the national park service has on record. Trains were crowded, and passengers were in jubilant and expectant mood, despite the early hour and subzero temperatures. Thousands of charter buses from across the country are in the capital, packing car parks and streets, many of which closed last night to accommodate the surge of overnight visitors and day-trippers. For the great gathering, Washington was locked down, with street closures, checkpoints, camouflage-clad soldiers at main intersections, air patrols and police boats in the harbour. As the crowds packed into the US Capitol grounds and nearby parkland to witness Obama take the oath of office, as many as 40,000 military, civilian and private security officers were on duty, roughly one for every 50 people in attendance. Just before Obama was sworn in, the homeland security department said it was investigating a potential threat ""of uncertain credibility"". Law enforcement and intelligence officials said they had received information that people associated with a Somalia-based group, al-Shabaab, may try to travel to the US with plans to disrupt the inauguration. Obama took his oath on the same Bible Abraham Lincoln used at his 1861 inauguration, when he proclaimed the end of slavery. Tomorrow, on his first working day in office, Obama is expected to fulfil his campaign promise to begin the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq under a 16-month timetable. Aides said he would summon the joint chiefs of staff to the Oval Office to order the pullout. Before the inauguration, the Vatican released a message from Pope Benedict XVI in which the Pontiff said he was praying that God would grant Obama ""unfailing wisdom and strength"" in carrying out his responsibilities. Benedict also said attention must be paid to the poor, the outcast, the hungry and ""those who have no voice""."
11,2009-01-20T17:24:43Z,News,Kenyans celebrate inauguration of 'our son' Obama,Festivities in full swing across the country where new US president's father was born,"""I'm tingling like I'm in a sauna,"" said Samson Wakoli, a 26-year-old bank worker, as he watched Barack Obama's speech with thousands of other Kenyans tonight on a giant screen near the shores of Lake Victoria. ""This gives me strength. We have waited so long. God is good, God is good, God is good."" As Bob Marley's One Love began to play, Ruth Odaga said she had been ""touched in a very special way"". ""Last January we were fighting here"" – the town of Kisumu was badly hit in Kenya's post-election violence – ""and now look at the happiness Obama has given everyone,"" she said. Celebrations were already in full swing across the country that includes ""the small village where my father was born"" that Obama referred to in his speech. In nearby Kogelo, where Obama Sr grew up, the party was at Barack Obama primary school, where classrooms had become makeshift hotels with names like Something Cold and Connie of Siaya. ""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old teacher. ""He is our son."" Male dancers wearing short pink-and-blue sisal skirts, feathers strapped to their arms and the occasional cloak made from the silky black and white fur of a colobus monkey, entertained the crowd. Hawkers sold T-shirts, calendars and traditional print wraps. A photographer was selling framed portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is from the region. George Otieno, 19, and in his final year of study at the adjacent secondary school, said: ""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said. ""If you believe something then you can do it."" Back at the sportsground in Kisumu, a young boy, perhaps eight years old, danced along to the music, telling anyone who would listen: ""I'm the next Barack Obama, OK?"""

As in the UK, the worry is about earnings, especially in the banking sector given the so far unquantified levels of toxic assets held on their balance sheets. The pomp and circumstance of the Presidential inauguration may be to the fore this afternoon, but investors cannot ignore the scale of the problems facing the new incumbent. Still, the UK market is holding up remarkably well, with the FTSE 100 down just 0.45 points at 4108.02 despite all the doom and gloom. Lloyds Banking Group is still the leading faller on worries it could be a candidate for nationalisation, but it has recovered from its worst levels and now sits 15.9p lower at 49.1p. Barclays is down 10.9p at 77.1p, while the revival in Royal Bank of Scotland has run out of steam, with its shares now down 0.5p at 11.1p. Ryan Kneale, market analyst at City bookmaker BetsForTraders said: ""The UK banking sector is finding no friends out in the market and appears to be on its last legs. A radical shake up of the system is needed, with the distinct possibility of the bigger'UK banks ending up Government owned. Even at these rock bottom prices you would have to be brave or stupid to buy into banks, when the chances of nationalisation are so high."" Among the risers, mining group Randgold Resources is ahead 151p to £28.76. Yesterday Investec raised its target price from £20.65 to £22.80.

16,2009-01-20T17:36:44Z,News,President Obama hails new 'Age of Responsibility',President Obama pledges to 'roll back the spectre of a warming planet' by changing the way America uses energy and the world's resources,"President Barack Obama, in his inaugural address to the packed crowds on the National Mall in Washington DC, told his rapt audience that America needed a ""new era of responsibility"" to deal with both the financial and environmental crises his new administration faced. After a stammering through the oath of office, the subtext of the gritty speech was that it would be hard – very hard – but America had the resourcefulness to reinvent itself. The new president's commitment to his environmental agenda shone through the dour images of a world economy in crisis with references to ""rolling back"" global warming through transforming the way America uses energy by harnessing ""the sun and the wind and the soil"". ""My fellow citizens. I stand here today humbled by the task before us,"" he said, ""Every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms."" Those storms are the metaphorical tempests on the global markets, but they are also the gales that will literally result from climate instability caused by rising CO2 emissions. Obama hinted that the Bush administration's championing of fossil fuels had created grave problems – both climatic and geopolitical. ""The ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and endanger our planet,"" he said, referring presumably to Middle Eastern oil. But ultimately, his message was one of hope. The challenges the country faces will are not insurmountable, he said. ""Know this America, they will be met,"" he said, ""On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear."" ""We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth… Our capacity remains undiminished,"" he added. Today was not a day for detailed solutions to the climate change threat or for a policy-wonk's guide to the new green economy that Obama promised on the campaign trail. That hard graft begins later. But there was a statement of intent that scientific and environmental issues would occupy a renewed place in the Oval Office. ""We will restore science to its rightful place,"" he said, ""We will harness the sun and the wind and the soil to fuel our cars."" Before the inaugaration, Obama had already delighted scientists and environmentalists with his choice of green-minded scientists that will join his administration and his professed attitude to scientific evidence. He has emphasised the need to listen to scientists, ""especially when it is inconvenient"". In a signal of this renewed respect for evidence he has restored the authority of the president's science advisor to the White House. Obama's pick for the position, John Holdren, professor of environmental policy at the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has been uncompromising in his warnings about the threat posed by climate change (he dislikes the phrase ""global warming"" because it he says oversimplifies the nature of the problem). The new president has invited Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University to become head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the government agency that studies the climate and monitors the health of marine ecosystems. She has been a powerful advocate for action on climate change. Obama has also received plaudits for his pick of Nobel prizewinning physicist Steven Chu for energy secretary. During the campaign, Obama committed himself to a $150bn investment over the next decade in green energy. He wants to put 1m plug-in hybrid cars, with a fuel consumption of 150 miles per gallon, on the road by 2015. He also pledged that 10% of US electricity supplies should come from renewable sources by 2012 and 25% by 2025. He also signalled an intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. He will be under pressure to make good on these commitments and quickly. In his closing statements, President Obama pledged to ""roll back the spectre of a warming planet"". But his message was even more fundamental than just changing the way the US and world uses energy. ""We can no longer afford indifference to the suffering that occurs outside our borders. Nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to the effect,"" he said. ""What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility… This is the price and promise of citizenship."" It remains to be seen whether ordinary Americans are prepared to take that responsibility and make the sacrifices their new leader is asking for."
17,2009-01-20T17:36:00Z,News,President Obama attacks 'failure' of Bush era,New president invokes spirit of America's founding citizens in inauguration speech to Washington crowds,"A passionate and determined Barack Obama used his inaugural address as the 44th president of the United States to deliver a stinging indictment of George Bush's eight years in power. In front of an estimated 1 million people outside the US Capitol and billions more watching around the world on television, the new president attacked a period of ""greed and irresponsibility"" and ""our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age"". There had been ""a sapping of confidence across our land, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable"", Obama said. As his predecessor looked on, hunched in his overcoat, Obama quoted scripture to herald a new era of maturity in Washington. ""The time has come to set aside childish things,"" he said. It was as though he wanted to reboot American politics by taking it back to the principles set by the father of the nation, the first president, George Washington. Obama proclaimed ""an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics"". Using an often epic sweep of reference ranging from Christian scripture to America's frontier history he reaffirmed his country's ""greatness"" and mapped out his ambition to get America back on course, which, he reminded his audience, was set by Washington fighting on the banks of the Potomac river during the war of independence. The president said America remained the ""most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth"" but added that ""our time of ... protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely passed"". In a metaphor that suggested America had been somehow knocked to the floor under the Bush administration, he said that ""starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America"". Obama raised the prospect of a new American era of hard work and determination, and early in his speech he invited the audience to remember the spirit of America's founding citizens, ""who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and travelled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west, endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth. ""We understand that greatness is never a given,"" he said, advocating a new era of humility in apparent contrast to the previous administration. ""It must be earned."" On foreign policy he promised a predictable hard line against terrorists and ""those who slaughter innocents"", warning in powerful tones that ""our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you"".But there was little to be gleaned about his strategy on Iraq and Afghanistan, which he dealt with in a single sentence: ""We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan."" This prompted more questions than answers about his policy on Afghanistan in particular. Did this mean he would press for a rapid end to hostilities or was he preparing for engagement lasting for years to come? He promised to ""seek a new way forward"" with Muslim countries ""based on mutual interest and mutual respect"" but said little else about one of the largest geopolitical fault lines he must negotiate in his presidency. There was, however, a determined effort to rebrand America as a multicultural and multi-faith nation after the Bush administration's focus on Christianity, which was backed by a pointed reference to ""restoring science to its rightful place"", and harnessing ""the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories"", one of several mentions of his green ambitions. Obama heralded the strength of his country's ""patchwork heritage"" – of which his own Kenyan/American ancestry is a good example. ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus"" as well as ""non-believers"", perhaps the first time this group has been mentioned in an inaugural address. Aid agencies around the world will have been pleased to hear him tell the other rich nations that ""we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders"". To the people of poor nations, he said: ""We pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds."""
18,2009-01-20T18:41:50Z,News,Obama inauguration speech 'stirs hopes' of black Americans,The first black US president inspires African-Americans with message of inclusion,"James Young Young is a pastor at a black church in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the small southern town in which one of the worst outrages of the civil rights era was carried out. Three young campaigners were killed in 1964 in events that were later enshrined in the film Mississippi Burning. Young watched Obama's speech at a local prison where he is a corrections officer. For him it was simply ""the most significant event I have seen in my lifetime"". The profound nature of the day for Young was not just about a black person like himself being declared president. ""He had an inclusive message for everyone in our nation – that we can do anything when we pull together and are no longer separated by colour and ideals."" As a boy Young lived through the segregation of schools in Philadelphia and threats from the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. He feels that the deep south still has a long way to go before rooting out discrimination, as it is ""so ingrained in our society over the years"". But he believes Obama's speech will have reached even Mississippi. ""He stirred up our hopes and invoked the constitution – telling us that we are all involved, we are all part of this country, and we should take our rightful place"". Peter Silver Silver watched the inauguration on a wide screen at the Harlem offices of the Reverend Al Sharpton where he works. He was in awe of the feat of oratory that Obama pulled off, but also affected more personally. ""I have inter-racial children and it was encouraging to me to hear him say that race, yes, does matter, but as a cultural component not an economic wall. It was like a celebration for my children, who now have a phenomenal role model, and my family and for me."" For Silver, the new president hit just the right note for the commander-in-chief and economist-in-chief at a time of such anxiety on both fronts. There was also a poignant moment for him relating to the former president George Bush. Obama was speaking about the need to reach out throughout the world to those who are willing rather than merely waging war, and at just that point the camera panned to Bush sitting on the side. ""He almost seemed a little bit shrunken, as if the past eight years had aged him. I have to admit, I felt a bit of remorse. The way I see it, Bush tried to do the best he could, he just wasn't the right person for the job."""
19,2009-01-20T19:27:51Z,News,Obama inauguration: 'He promised a new American revolution',In their own words: political bloggers analyse the new US president's inaugural address,"Alex Koppelman, Salon The new president's speech was lofty in its language, but its subject was, in some sense, as earthy as it gets. What Barack Obama said today was that the story of American freedom is social history – the stuff of ordinary people's lives. The gist of Obama's argument during the campaign was that the trouble with our politics was that it had nothing to do with what was actually happening in people's lives. Struggles in cities and towns around the country seemed to have nothing to do with action in Washington, as if it were another country's capital. David Frum, New Majority One thing to learn from that speech – Obama is adjusting to his new role. He has learned that he must delegate even his own writing, which cannot have been easy. I feel sure that speech was not the personal work of this highly eloquent man. It takes a team of highly trained professionals to produce something quite so flat! it seems to evoke every oft-expressed thought and repeat so many well-worn phrases. Andrew Sullivan, The Daily Dish Emotionally, it spoke for itself. I cannot deny there are tears in my eyes. Intellectually, this struck me as the core point: ""What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them – that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works. The ability to put behind the ideologies of the recent past in order to regain the values of American history is the core message, it seems to me. He was arguing that we need to think again, to put aside childish things, and that this is the mark of responsibility and adulthood. Jacob Heilbrunn, Huffington Post He promised a new American revolution. His evocation of George Washington at the end of his address made it clear that he regards the perils that face the country as almost no less daunting than those that it confronted in battling for its independence. Obama's inaugural address, sober and dignified, has set the foundation for constructing a new gleaming edifice of democracy. It is up to us as much as Obama to construct it. Roger Simon, Politico He looked very serious, almost sombre, throughout his inaugural ceremony. And as he has done repeatedly in the last few weeks, he listed the barriers America faces, the mountains we have yet to climb. Will any of these words someday be carved in marble? That depends not on the words, but on the presidency. Nobody remembers the words of failed administrations. Robert Kaiser, Washington Post A memorable inaugural address. There haven't been many in my experience. Obama clearly wrote this one, as any reader of his books could immediately attest. I was also struck by the shots he took at Bush, with the outgoing president sitting right there. Think how Bush heard this line: ""Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."""
20,2009-01-20T17:22:03Z,News,Obama inauguration: Iranian enthusiasm tempered by policy doubts,• Khatami announces candidacy hours before Obama takes oath• Disappointment in silence on Ahmadinejad congratulation,"Barack Obama took office just hours after the moderate former president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, officially announced his candidacy for Iran's upcoming presidential elections. This gave the thousands of Iranians who were watching the inauguration ceremony via their illegal satellite dishes a glimmer of hope that three decades of Iran-US hostility might be about to end. Hamed Mohaghegh, 21, an industrial civil engineering student in Tehran, watching the ceremony on BBC, said that the US had given its democracy a boost by electing an black man as president,. ""Before Obama was elected, we had this impression in our country that a black man will never succeed to become the president of the States, a candidate who had an Arabic middle name, Hussein."" ""Ahmadinejad has also doubted - saying that he thinks that [American voters would] not let a black man become the president of the US,"" said Reza Ahmadi, 40, an Iranian math teacher at high school. Yet, others were disappointed that Obama has not responded to the letter of congratulation sent by Ahmadinejad to Obama. ""It seems that the whole world has a share of Obama's Change That Can Happen except Iranian people"", he added. Ali Mohammadi, 37, an Iranian businessman thinks that bringing Obama on the US political stage was the only choice Americans had. ""America is not popular and powerful as before, the US is rather notorious for its background in Iraq and Afghanistan right now and is facing an economical crisis, so Obama was the only one to stabilise the States not only economically but also to gets back the US ex-reputation in the world,"" he said. Media Kashigar, 52, a well-known Iranian intellectual and critic believes that the US foreign policy has not changed at least in the past 30 years toward Iran. ""Iran-US conflict is not a governmental or administrational problem. It is a mutual state problem, so I think neither Obama nor anyone else in Iran can ease the debate easily in next future"", he said. ""I don't think the US president has much influence to change American foreign policy. We've experienced JF Kennedy, we've seen Clinton and Bush, but has there been any foreign policy apparent change in past 60 years in the US?"", said Amirmehdi Rezaee, 60, an Iranian retired-employee of the Iranian government."

President Barack Obama had barely let go of the Bible on which he had sworn the oath of office before the front page of the White House website had been radically altered. At 12.01pm eastern standard time, out went the rather text-heavy Bush administration front page on whitehouse.gov, with its sections on: Global War on Terror; the Freedom Agenda; the Bush Record and Mrs Bush's Leadership. Instead those clicking on it were welcomed by a smiling photograph of President Obama under the headline : ""Change has come to America"", along with a gallery of images that included the whole Obama family getting out and interacting with the community and text sections on subjects such as Honouring Dr King's Legacy and Serving America. A video of The Whistle Stop Tour showed Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, vice-president Joe Biden, and his wife Dr Jill Biden ""following the same route that Abraham Lincoln rode 150 years ago … [on] their way to the inauguration on a whistle stop train tour that wove its way from Philadelphia through Delaware and Maryland on its way to Washington"". Before midday, the website had a picture of George Bush, holding hands with Laura Bush making their way along a red carpet laid outside the north portico of the White House. It now says: ""WhiteHouse.gov will be a central part of President Obama's pledge to make his the most transparent and accountable administration in American history."""
22,2009-01-20T18:35:00Z,News,Euphoric crowd greets Obama speech in Tottenham arts centre,"'Not since Nelson Mandela has anything felt so much like liberation,' says leading black academic as Obama supporters gather to watch inauguration on TV in north London","At the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham, north London, the crowd waiting to watch Barack Obama's inauguration as president of the United States was approximately 60% black, 40% white – and 100% euphoric. The auditorium was so full the security guards had to keep people who were sitting on the stairs moving. There wasn't much more room in the balcony, where people were standing at least two deep. The anticipation built throughout the afternoon, with the cheers getting louder each time Obama was pictured on the screen. Earlier on, actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah got a huge cheer as he told how, once Obama had secured the Democratic nomination, he had tried to put all thoughts of inauguration to one side for fear that the day would never come. So too did African-American playwright Bonnie Greer when she faltered slightly, holding back the emotion at the thought of what she was about to witness. ""I have to go home to talk to my mama,"" said Greer, who is from the same area of Chicago as Michelle Obama. ""Not since Nelson Mandela has anything felt so much like liberation. In fact, not since Ghana became the first independent African state,"" said leading black academic Mike Phillips. The venue, a £15m arts complex, is named after the late Tottenham MP Bernie Grant. His successor, David Lammy, the skills minister, got a warm cheer when he appeared on the screen from Washington to say hello to his constituents. As Obama took his place, a hush descended. When he opened his mouth to speak the crowd went wild. ""I feel honoured and privileged to see Martin Luther King's words come to pass. As a black mother, I am elated to see that day come, and I hope it continues for many years to come,"" said Monica White, 65, from Tottenham. At the other end of the spectrum was 10-year-old Elisha Hatton, who was watching with her eight-year-old brother, Elliot. How did she feel? ""I'm really happy because Barack Obama is making history,"" said Hatton, who attends nearby St Paul's school. ""It's next door to Spurs,"" said Hatton, proudly. So who did she prefer, Spurs or Obama? ""Obama, of course,"" said Hatton."
23,2009-01-20T21:42:56Z,News,Obama inauguration: Let the remaking of America begin today,NA,"Barack Hussein Obama was today sworn in as 44th president of the United States of America in front of quite possibly the largest mass of humanity ever to have gathered in one place for a single political moment. As many as 2 million people in Washington's National Mall heard their new commander-in-chief deliver a sombre 20-minute speech in which he acknowledged that the country was in the midst of crisis – mired in wars, its economy struggling and its national confidence sapped. He promised the largely silent crowd that the challenges would be met, but warned it would take time, some sacrifice, a new form of politics and a re-engagement with the world, in which America would recognise that ""power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please"". President Obama took the oath just after midday under a crisp and cloudless azure sky in front of the glistening cream dome of the Capitol, which, it is now accepted, was partly built by slaves. The day, cold enough to freeze breath, had begun with millions of individual journeys by coach, train and on foot as the crowds began converging before dawn for a moment widely taken as one of renewal and of double foreclosure. This was to be the end of the last eight years of Republican rule and of the bars which, at any previous time in history, would have made the election of an African American president unthinkable. They had come to celebrate – and for days they had been doing just that in parties and balls all over town. The cheer as Obama swore his oath on Lincoln's Bible rippled and roared all the way from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol, nearly two miles away. But when Obama spoke it was immediately apparent that the tone of this inauguration was grave, addressed as much to the hundreds of millions tuned in around the world as to the shimmering sea of upturned faces in front of him. ""That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood,"" he said. ""Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. ""Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our healthcare is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."" If this was read as a repudiation of the previous eight years of Bush, there was plenty more of it. There was, said Obama, a nagging fear that American decline was inevitable; he wanted an end to ""petty grievances and false promises""; the time had passed for ""protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions""; a nation could not prosper long ""when it favours only the prosperous"". In one of the few lines to be greeted by fervent applause, he turned to defence, proclaiming ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals"". In a thinly-veiled reference to Guantánamo and torture he promised not to abandon the rule of law and human rights ""for expedience's sake"". There was further implicit criticism of his predecessor's policies in his comments on science and the environment. He vowed to ""restore science to its rightful place"" and made several references to climate change, acknowledging the threat to our planet and saying America would in future ""harness the sun and the winds and the soil"" for energy. On international affairs, he singled out the Muslim world, offering ""a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. America would leave Iraq ""to its people"" and forge a ""hard-earned peace"" in Afghanistan. All inauguration ceremonies consciously celebrate, and reference, both the constitution and former presidents. Four ghosts hovered over yesterday's ceremony. Lincoln's Gettysburg address gave the new president the overarching theme for his speech – the ""new birth of freedom"". It is Lincoln, the gangly lawyer from Illinois, who has fascinated Obama more than any other previous president. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves and yesterday's inauguration were in some ways bookends to the darkest stain on America's history. For many in the crowd this was the over-riding reason for the pilgrimage to Washington. Obama put it simply: ""A man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."" The second ghost was Martin Luther King, who, had he lived, would have been an 80-year-old spectator. No one in the crowd could have been oblivious to the echo across time of the words that had rung out from the other end of the National Mall 45 years previously. And then there were JFK and FDR. Obama's call for responsibility and sacrifice recalled both Kennedy in 1961 and Roosevelt's heartfelt cry in 1933: ""We now realise as we have never realised before our interdependence on each other."" Obama's serious tone and his unflinching acknowledgement of the economic hurricane blowing through America echoed Roosevelt's speech at the time of the last serious global depression, in which an incoming president vowed ""to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly … with a candour … which the present situation of our nation impels"". The endless crowd listened solemnly to the same sentiments today. They might have come wishing for something more uplifting, but, for many, the day reached beyond symbolism to a moment of genuine transformation after which nothing could be the same again. As Obama headed back into the Capitol building at the end of the ceremony clouds began rolling over what had until then been a pure blue sky. But there was one final, rousing cheer as the helicopter carrying George W Bush rose over the gleaming dome of government and took the former president off to Texas – and out of public life for ever."

But for the 13 locals who set off from a hospital car park on Monday night for Barack Obama's inauguration, this was no ordinary trip. They left the country to camp in the city. Braced for maximum discomfort they wore heavy boots, rucksacks, several layers, sleeping bags and blankets. They came to sleep on the floor, inch through the crowds and stand in the cold. They came to be part of something bigger than themselves. They came for history. And they got what they came for. ""Just to be there and be part of that energy will be great,"" said Sarah Goodman, as she baked cookies during the day. ""It's like being part of the grand finale of this hard work and I just have to be there."" Marjorie Joyce wanted to extend the giddy feeling of election night for as long as possible. ""It's a continuation of everything we worked for during the election and the excitement that I felt on election night,"" she said. ""When everyone was united in believing that America was about everyone pulling together. I was wanting to feel that in person and be among the people."" With a few exceptions, they spoke of Obama's inauguration as though it were an inevitable fact of life - the logical consequence of the American people surveying the choices and picking the best. But when I arrived in Roanoke five weeks before the election, the mood was anything but bold. Obama supporters discussed their allegiance in hushed tones. Some in a nearby town asked one campaigner not to reveal their support for fearthey might be ostracised. They had come a long way since those dog days of September: on election day Virginia went Democratic for the first time in more than 40 years. And now they just had a little bit further to go - 250 miles and a four-hour drive. We hadn't even left Roanoke when the road signs warned of traffic delays for the inauguration. But the mood remained bright. Sarah passed around her cookies and Marjorie wanted to take bets on what Michelle Obama would be wearing. Brian thought purple; Marjorie guessed red. The traffic was clear shortly after midnight as we drove into Washington. Before we could roll out our sleeping bags and bed down for the night Terri wanted to brief us for the day ahead. Holding up a map she guided us through the next day with a few useful pointers. Bring toilet paper - there may be 5,000 Portapotties lining the Mall but apparently few of them were stocked. Look out for the JumboTrons, the giant screens punctuating the Mall that made it feel like you were both watching the event on television and that you were there. And stay warm. The forecast was for snow in the evening and harsh cold in the morning. We woke at about six today with sleep in our eyes and hope in the air. Outside a trickle of visitors passed the house at dawn, soon turning into a stream and within an hour a flood. As 10 of us set off our strides were reduced to baby steps by the crowd. They'd come for a ringside seat on history, but at that moment it wasn't clear whether we would find a seat or even get to see the ring. We spent the next 90 minutes nudging our way forward step by step, sometimes following people who were themselves lost. We found our own piece of Promised Land by the Washington monument, surrounded by flags and with a good view of a JumboTron. Like a lost tribe by that stage, we were down to just three - the rest abandoned on corners unknown. As Obama raised his hand Terri said she never thought she would see the day. A tear fell from below her glasses. Her bold assertion of a holiday booked a year in advance gave way to the reality of making that dream come true in relatively conservative Roanoke. ""This is not something I thought I would live to see in my lifetime. A black man becoming president ... It's been a pretty amazing journey."""
25,2009-01-20T19:28:57Z,News,Obama inauguration: John F Kennedy's speechwriter hails Obama's address,"Kennedy's principal speechwriter - who wrote the January 1961 inaugural address which included the lines: ""Ask not what your country can do for you…"" - on President Obama's inaugural speech","Today was a very emotional day for me. Of course it brought back very powerful memories of January 1961, but I have been a strong supporter of Obama since the day he declared his intention to run. My friends told me that I was crazy, that he had no chance, a liberal Democrat and a black man. So yes, it was emotional to watch him take the oath of office. It was a great day, and the speech and its contents symbolise the greatness of the day, and the change that this country is embarking upon, now that the eight years of the previous administration are over at last. In terms of delivery it was excellent, very forceful and very well paced, and his sincerity and commitment came through. But there were parts of the speech in which he made it clear that he had compassion for those who had suffered from the economic collapse, just as there were parts of the speech where he made it clear that the reliance solely on military power, which he said cannot alone protect us, that those days are over. Parts were certainly downbeat, and in terms of speech psychology there are probably those who would have advised him otherwise. Nevertheless, each time he followed with upbeat statements that we were going to overcome those challenges. That we had a strong economy, and a productive workforce. Taken as a whole, it struck a very hopeful note. I thought as a whole it was a very thoughtful speech. It invoked our ancestors and the struggles they went through to keep freedom alive, and I thought that that was very appropriate at this time. The conclusion in particular was very strong, which made reference to the earliest struggles for independence and liberty, when Britain was the oppressor. And I have to assume that it will be hailed overseas. My experience is that great speeches are frequently in the eye of the beholder: Obama is so respected, even beloved, around the world that I think the speech will be hailed. I have been speaking for two years of the parallels between Obama and Kennedy: two young senators, Kennedy even younger than Obama, two men committed to peace. Two men with progressive domestic policies and a multilateral foreign policy. Two men who reached out to young people and brought them into the campaign, and now, in Obama's case, bringing them into government. President Kennedy, I am sure, would be beside himself with joy at today's events, having turned our country around in its attitudes towards our black citizens, with his speech to the nation, and then his legislation to Congress in June 1963. The very idea of a black man being elected president, when in those days blacks could not be elected to almost any office, including the House of Representatives; he would think it was a wonderful day for America."
26,2009-01-20T18:47:34Z,News,"Obama brings new voice of hope, Nelson Mandela says","In a letter to new US president, former South African leader describes Obama's election as 'something truly historic'","Fifteen years after the world celebrated the election of a black president that many doubted would ever happen, Nelson Mandela has written to Barack Obama comparing his inauguration to the inspiration provided by South Africa's embrace of democracy. In a letter delivered to Obama before the ceremony, the former South African president described the election of America's first black president as ""something truly historic not only in the political annals of your great nation, the United States of America, but of the world"". ""We are in some ways reminded today of the excitement and enthusiasm in our own country at the time of our transition to democracy,"" Mandela said in the letter. ""People, not only in our country but around the world, were inspired to believe that through common human effort injustice can be overcome and that together a better life for all can be achieved."" Mandela told Obama he represents a ""new voice of hope"" in a world still beset by inequality and division. ""Your election to this high office has inspired people as few other events in recent times have done. Amidst all of the human progress made over the last century the world in which we live remains one of great divisions, conflict, inequality, poverty and injustice,"" said Mandela. ""You, Mister President, have brought a new voice of hope that these problems can be addressed and that we can in fact change the world and make of it a better place."" Mandela also reminded Obama of his Kenyan origins, although even today in South Africa the new US president would commonly be regarded as ""coloured"" or mixed race, and not black. ""There is a special excitement on our continent today, Mister President, in the knowledge that you have such strong personal ties with Africa. We share in that excitement and pride,"" he said."
27,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Obama inauguration: How the presidency will be handed over,NA,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 23 January 2009 The Bush family did not return to the White House following Barack Obama's inauguration as president. They left Washington DC in a helicopter directly from Capitol Hill, the site of the ceremony. At 12.01pm today, special agent Donald White will take a few small steps that will mark a giant leap for his country. The secret service officer will move away from George Bush and stand behind President Obama, marking the transition of his protection to a new presidency. The by-now former president Bush will then return to the White House, and with his family take off in Marine One from the south lawn for the last time. The helicopter will take them to Andrews air force base, where they will be joined by Dick Cheney and his family, and a select group of friends. Finally, the Bushes will fly in Air Force One - though it will not be called that, because the name applies only when it is ferrying the serving president - to Midland, Texas; and thence to a new home in a suburb of Dallas, and a new life. Leaving the White House after eight years will be a poignant moment for the Bushes. At least they will be spared the callously quick handover of British prime ministers, with the humiliating exchange of removal vans on the day after the election. The only piece of furniture said to be going with them is a chest of drawers belonging to George Bush's grandmother, a contrast from 19th-century presidents who used to take everything with them. Bush administration staff have handed in their security passes, BlackBerrys and phones and coded lapel pins. Only the chief of staff, Josh Bolten, and a couple of other senior officials remain on duty. For a couple of hours, the White House will be empty of all but its permanent domestic staff. William Seale, a White House historian, recalls being in the building at that time. ""It's a wonderfully still time, with no political people around. Everything is waiting."" After lunch the Obamas will arrive. Their removal trucks will precede them, lining up on the south drive. For the first time, a black first family will enter the White House and a new era will begin."
28,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Obama inauguration: Great pilgrimage to witness 'crazy exciting' day,NA,"Gonzalez had minimal expectations when he signed up for a ticket on his senator's website, figuring they would go to the lucky or well-connected. He was neither - until 22 December when his number came up. ""Getting this ticket was exactly like winning the lottery,"" Gonzalez said. ""I've never won anything before."" Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans who will witness the final stage of Obama's journey down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, Gonzalez's trip to Washington is, in its own way, as improbable as the president's. Gonzalez knew no one in Washington, and could barely afford the air fare let alone the inflated rates of hotel rooms in inauguration week. He had to spend 10 hours a day preparing a lesson plan for the teacher who would take over his classes at a school in a poor area of Albuquerque, New Mexico. But yesterday saw Gonzalez and his partner, Phelosha Collaros, wheeling their luggage through a congressional office building, just east of the spot where Barack Obama will take the oath, inauguration tickets in hand. Collaros videoed every step of their journey for a short course Gonzalez will teach on his return. ""My students are way way out in New Mexico,"" he said. ""Most of them will never get a chance to come to Washington in their lives, so I feel a duty to bring something back to them."" A few blocks west, beneath the steps of the Capitol, Ekilah Poles, in orange gloves and furry hat, posed with her friends for photographs in front of a huge screen reading: ""44th president"". Poles reckoned yesterday was her best chance to see what Obama will see when he takes the oath on the steps of a Capitol draped with flags. She drove eight hours from Columbia, South Carolina to be in Washington, but does not have a ticket to the ceremony. ""I will be with my brethren on the mall,"" she said. Poles realises that Obama comes to office lumbered with expectations. But all she really wants is for him to connect with ordinary Americans. ""He is not going to be able to work miracles, but I expect him to tell us what hardships we are facing, and how he is going to get us through,"" she said. ""We don't necessarily have to agree."" Tim Andersen and Irina Kushner, lawyers who live in the Virginia suburbs, hurried along through the first flakes of snow. They wanted their view of history in advance. ""It's going to be too hectic dealing with everything and the road closures,"" said Andersen. Others could scarcely stay away, like the six students in Washington for just 10 days before leaving on an exchange programme to Tanzania, who congregated in front of the FBI headquarters, about halfway along Obama's route today. ""This is crazy exciting,"" said Claire Richard, a student from Oklahoma. ""It's really touched people. My grandmother who is 96 is so jazzed."" Phil and Tracie Davis, bankers from Charlotte, North Carolina, were on a dry run with their daughter, Ariel, three. ""We just want to get a sense of how she is going to do in the crowds,"" said Tracie. The couple had paid over the odds for a hotel room near the parade route, but did not manage to find tickets to the inauguration. No matter. ""We just came to soak it all in and so she will have a story to tell her grandchildren."" For guests with the means to secure a room at the luxury Willard hotel, the atmosphere will come to them. It is a mere two blocks from the White House and offers a prime view of the parade route. Anna Oginsky, who is from Michigan, booked rooms for her husband and three young children and her mother last October, even before Obama was elected. ""I just knew it was going to happen,"" she said. That sense of anticipation was building as the day wore on, and further west along Pennsylvania Avenue to No 1600, the address of the White House, the viewing stand, with its blue presidential seal and Plexiglass windows, where Obama will watch the parade in his honour, is complete. The stands for dignitaries have gone up. A few reminders of the George Bush era remain - such as the protester shrouded in black with a sign reading: ""You boys sure know how to throw a bloodbath."" But by noon today, when Obama officially takes over as president, all that will be swept away. So too will Charlene Andrews's feeling of indifference towards the city where she was born and raised. For the first time, Andrews, 40, intends to see an inauguration with her own eyes, and to take her son, Caleb, nine. The cafeteria of her workplace, a federal courthouse, has a magnificent view of the Capitol. ""I never felt a connection before,"" she said. ""I guess we take our city for granted, the fact that all this is around us."" Today that changes for the Andrews. ""This is so exciting,"" she said. ""I'm overwhelmed."""
29,2009-01-20T20:49:28Z,Opinion,All the conservative trappings freed Obama to frame a radical message,The inauguration was brimming with tradition – just the platform for a president who could be truly transformational,"The ritual performed today on the steps of the US Capitol honoured tradition in every particular – even if America's new president stumbled over the time-honoured form of words that was his oath of office. Americans, lacking a monarchy, attach a near-sacred reverence to the inauguration that serves as a kind of coronation: its precise order of ceremonies, its protocols. And Obama did nothing to challenge that today. True, Aretha Franklin sang My country 'tis of thee, and Yitzhak Perlman led a distinctly modern arrangement by film composer John Williams. But otherwise, this was an exercise in tradition. Yet Obama delivered a message that was anything but conservative, offering a thorough rebuttal of his predecessor's foreign policy and signalling a break in the nearly 30-year grip the notion of limited government has exerted on US politics. Taken together, what that brief spell under the blue winter skies of Washington DC suggested was an approach that may come to characterise the Obama presidency. It is conservative in style, radical in substance. So note the exclusive presence of Protestant clergy in today's proceedings, despite the celebration of inclusivity that Obama's inauguration symbolised for so many. What's more, the invocation was given by Rev Rick Warren, a powerful evangelist who maintains a hard line against abortion, and backed last year's California campaign to outlaw gay marriage. That choice outraged many on the left – among them those in the crowds who booed when Warren took the podium today – but it reassured America's cultural conservatives. Obama's personal style is similarly comforting to the right. They like the fact that he is sober and calm in demeanour, with a wife and two daughters who could be an advertisement for family values. They would have similarly warmed as he hymned the virtues required for the US to lift itself out of the hole it is in now. The challenges may be new, he said, ""But those values upon which our success depends – hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism – these things are old."" Obama has written before of the pressure on a black man in a mainly white society to appear unthreatening. Whether that explains his serene public style or not matters less than its effect, which is to assure many Americans that there is nothing frighteningly radical about their new president. But just listen to what he said. In one exquisite paragraph, he repudiated – and terminated – the with-us-or-against-us, force-first-not-last, macho foreign policy of the Bush era. Obama recalled the earlier generations who defeated ""fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. Obama delivered a message that many on the left had hoped he would bring, and which many on the right equally feared. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" The notion of a president speaking in such a way, and so directly, to the Muslim world would have been unimaginable just months ago. Obama offered a warning to dictatorships that could apply to those who have long been recipients of US aid and comfort. The rulers of Egypt, among others, may have shifted in their seats as they heard him say ""you are on the wrong side of history; but we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist"". Audiences around the world would have been heartened by that, as they would by Obama's unexpectedly intense focus on climate change. He returned to it several times, until it became one of the speech's clearest threads. ""Each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet,"" he said. Later he vowed to ""harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories"". There was a time when all this would have been condemned as dangerous radicalism in an American politician. But Obama's conservative style – the fact that he invented a new tradition this year, by speaking at inauguration eve dinners in honour of Colin Powell and John McCain – gives him the space to act differently where it matters, on the substance. There is a precedent, albeit indirect, for this trick. It comes from the man Obama hailed during the 2008 campaign as a ""transformational"" president: Ronald Reagan. Once elected, Reagan did not look over his shoulder at the previous consensus. Instead he seized the moment to drive through his own small government agenda, assuming the public would soon come around. He did not feel obliged to meet the centre-left halfway. And yet he wrapped it all in a warmth and charm that ensured it was not threatening. He too was a radical on substance, no matter how cosily traditional his style. So now it could be Obama's turn to be transformational, not just in the words of a speech but in the deeds that Americans will expect from him, starting today. Some early signs are encouraging, including the hint from senior counsellor David Axelrod that the next phase of the federal bail-out will be very different from the first tranche of spending under the man we can now call – with a deep, heartfelt sigh of relief – former President Bush. Obama will focus not on bailing out the banks but US workers. Expect a large dose of government spending on manufacturing industry, especially on projects with a green tinge. What could blow Obama off course? The Republican pollster Frank Luntz warns of two perils. The first danger comes from abroad. Now that Obama has promised to engage America's adversaries, he will enter unpredictable waters. If the new president were to have a summit with, say, the Iranians or even the Russians, and the meeting were to go badly, with Obama somehow seen to have been taken for a ride – then that might burst the Obama bubble. Alternatively, warns Luntz, if House Democrats tug the new president leftwards that could puncture the image of the bipartisan, above the fray leader – reducing him in the minds of the electorate to the status of just another politician. That's plausible enough, given the unpopularity of the Democratic brand in the years since 1980. But it might also badly underestimate the current appetite for change. The triangulations of Bill Clinton may well have been politically necessary 15 years ago. But now, having seen the economy plunge so badly, many Americans seem ready for more radical medicine. Still, none of this should obscure the wonder of what happened in Washington today. Perhaps two million people woke at dawn and made difficult journeys in the frigid cold not to go to the January sales or to see a free concert but to watch a politician become their president. God knows the US has been a difficult country to love these last eight years. But today it showed its most inspiring face – that it is still a nation that cherishes its unique experiment in self-government and still believes that even the darkest chapters in its past can be transcended."
30,2009-01-20T19:48:30Z,News,Obama inauguration: George Bush - the man who was no longer president,"• 43rd president leaves note in the Resolute desk for successor• Bushes head to Midland, Texas after ceremony","A brass band playing Hail to the Chief just about drowned out the boos. As George Bush stepped onto the inaugural balcony outside Congress, the vast crowd's reception was, at best, lukewarm. The outgoing president, who wore a broad smile for most of the day, briefly allowed a flicker of apprehension to pass across his face. This was not quite the farewell he would have wanted. Bush's final day in public office appeared something of an ordeal. He sat expressionessly through Barack Obama's inaugural address which was coded with criticism of the last eight years, then shifted restlessly during Elizabeth Alexander's celebratory poem. He ignored chants of ""no more Bush"" and ""bye bye Bush"" from the masses in the Mall, grinning gamely as he glad-handed the VIPs sitting alongside him. The two presidents made a joint effort to exude bonhomie. Earlier in the day, as they arrived at the White House for morning coffee, the Obamas presented a gift wrapped with a red ribbon to George and Laura Bush. The smiles were warm and Obama made a point of publicly thanking his predecessor for his ""generosity and cooperation"" during the transition. In keeping with custom, Bush left a note for his successor in the top drawer of the presidential desk in the Oval Office. Press secretary Dana Perino said the letter contained good wishes and were about ""the fabulous new chapter President-elect Obama is about to start"". Saddled with approval ratings in the 20s, Bush has kept his exit low key. His staff organised a leaving party on Sunday evening in a ballroom at Glen Echo Park, a stretch of greenery just outside Washington. The dress code was casual, in part because the venue wasn't heated, but White House staffers clad in fleeces tried to raise spirits by waving giant cut-outs of W's. At a final press briefing, the White House said that even on his last day, Bush was at his desk before 7am for a last round of briefings with his national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, and his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. Bush took a stroll around the building's south grounds before the day's ceremonial events began. Arriving for the inauguration, those around Bush looked increasingly old and weary. Dick Cheney turned up in a wheelchair, having injured his back moving boxes into his new home in suburban Virginia. Bush's father, former president George HW Bush, appeared doddery, swaddled against the cold and leaning heavily on a cane. After taking the oath of office and finishing his speech, Obama walked over and hugged Bush. The two first families then went together to the east side of the Capitol, where there was an awkward hiatus of a few minutes as they waited for the departure of a vice-presidential motorcade, swapping remarks and smiling. The departing first family clambered into a helicopter to take them to Andrews air force base where they were due to travel on to a more convivial crowd of well-wishers gathered at a square in Bush's childhood hometown of Midland, Texas. For the journey south, the Bushes rode on the blue and white Boeing 747 usually known as Air Force One - but temporarily renamed Special Air Mission 28000, given that its passenger was no longer president."
31,2009-01-20T17:49:31Z,News,Londoners toast Obama's arrival in the White House,NA,"Who needs Washington when there's west London? Approximately 3,660 miles away from the White House, the champagne was giddily sloshing, alongside the occasional latte grande. Elisabeth Murdoch, her husband, PR maestro Matthew Freud, and Ruth Rogers, proprieter of the dining room for everyone important, The River Cafe in London, pooled together their impressive address books to organise an inauguration party, which was held this afternoon. Where? In Notting Hill, of course, an area of London that increasingly seems to exist purely for Americans. Aptly, if inevitably, among the guests was director Richard Curtis, who pretty much sold the area to foreigners with his cinematic ode to the area, Notting Hill, which depicted an unlikely Anglo-American love affair. And that transatlantic adoration was in full flow in the Electric Cinema on Portobello Road. ""Ruth called me at what, 4pm on Sunday?"" began the clubbable Freud, looking to his co-host for confirmation. ""Exactly, 4pm,"" she nodded, staring at the cinema screen which was showing events on Sky News. Well, you wouldn't expect CNN at a Murdoch party. ""And by Monday, it was all organised,"" he finished. Neither Rogers nor Freud are virgins to Obama parties. One fundraiser held by Freud and Murdoch last year raised $500,000, allegedly the biggest sum raised at an event where Obama was not present. ""We in Britain have a political regime that's in its maturity – can I be any more tactful? So to see someone so new is inspiring,"" said Freud. Were they not tempted to go to DC for the inauguration? ""Real life got in the way,"" replied Murdoch, looking for her children in the crowd. ""And this party was fun to organise because everyone could come, not just Americans,"" added Rogers. Everyone was, indeed, there. Alan Rickman and Antonia Fraser chatted by the bar. Sam Taylor-Wood kissed Thandie Newton hello. Jemima Goldsmith and Elle Macpherson appeared to be engaged in a competition over who had the most shampoo advert-worthy hair and Bob Geldof sulked at the back. Perhaps to signal that, contrary to all appearances, he was excited about the afternoon's upcoming events, he wore an alarming pink jumper. Proving that all famous people know each other, everyone kissed everyone. And then, into this glossy mix came the latest addition to the west London scene: the oligarch. As the lights in the cinema were beginning to dim in anticipation of Obama's speech, Evgeny Lebedev – the son of Aleksander Lebedev, the Russian billionaire and possibly the future proprietor of the London Evening Standard – crept quietly in. At the first sight of a journalist's notebook, Evgeny fled to the bar, accompanied by a protective Freud. Claudia Schiffer was chattier. ""I've always been a fan of Obama,"" she avowed. Had she considered going to DC for the inauguration? ""Oh no, it's much more comfortable here. It's like watching in your living room,"" she replied, spotting fellow model Laura Bailey through the waiters carrying trays of champagne. So there were oligarchs and authors, supermodels and chefs. The only people that seemed to be missing were, funnily enough, Americans. But the cupcakes with American flag icing were some compensation for the absence of Gwyneth and Madonna. By 4.45pm the lights were down and most people were in their seats. It was like being at a very A-list film premiere. All small talk ceased, apart from the occasional urgent dash to the bar for another glass of champagne. And just when everything was beginning to feel a little solemn, the composer of Cats swept in. So what brought Andrew Lloyd-Webber, aka, Lord Lloyd-Webber of Sydmonton, here? He gave a little chuckle, ""Well, I was just filming at the BBC around the corner."" So it was convenient? ""Exactly!"""
32,2009-01-20T17:36:15Z,Opinion,Obama's speech,More prose than poetry means: it's time to get down to work.,"A presidential inaugural address can be pitched either to the ages, replete with eternal verities, or to the particular moment, cataloguing the challenges of the day, but rarely to both. I think most of us expected the former from Barack Hussein Obama, whose most stirring oratories have certainly sung with ageless poetry. This speech had those moments, to be sure, and Obama from time to time reached back to Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and even to Paul the Apostle. But what was surprising was how rooted in the current moment the speech was. Obama chose to speak in specific terms – one might even say programmatic ones – about the dire present moment and his plans for how to get out of it. Only a few minutes into the speech he was mentioning jobs, homes and healthcare, and building roads and bridges, and investing in new sources of energy and improving education. A few of the lines were so on-message that they would have worked well in a closing statement during a presidential debate. There is precedent for this. Franklin Roosevelt's inaugural addresses, his first and second ones in particular, were pitched directly at the moment Americans faced then. That we are in the midst of an economic crisis greater than any since Roosevelt's time obviously motivated Obama to move his rhetoric in this direction. But I felt he may have pressed a little too far in that direction. When he mentioned ""electric grids"" and ""digital lines,"" he sounded like he has about a half a beat away from diving into a discussion of the competing merits of corn- versus switchgrass-based ethanol. Another way in which the speech was geared toward the moment: it was, in parts, a coded but unmistakably clear denunciation of the Bush administration. ""As for our common defense,"" he said, ""we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals."" The line drew a big cheer from the nearly two-million-strong Obama enthusiasts on the mall, and they knew exactly what he meant: no more Guantanamos, no more torture, no more Dick Cheney-style governance (and the sight of Cheney in that wheelchair…what was he doing packing his own boxes anyway?). And how about the line about how America's founding fathers ""understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please?"" Obama may be ready to cooperate with congressional Republicans, as he has often stated, but it has to be said that at least with regard to Bush and Cheney, even Obama's penchant for post-partisanship clearly has its limits. The speech's most stirring passages were directed not to Americans but to the world, and here, I think the speech was more in line with the high expectations. Here, he moved away from Roosevelt and leaned more on John Kennedy's 1961 address. His words ""to the people of poor nations"" were moving, and those addressed ""to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent"" were stern. The world will be listening to this president with more care and respect than most, so one hopes that over the next four years those words are backed up by some actions. If the speech was mildly underwhelming, I suppose I'd say this. There were many times during the campaign when I, and other political junkies of my acquaintance, thought Obama was screwing something up. A week or a month later, we almost invariably saw that maybe he was right after all. So maybe he thought, let's put the poetry on the shelf. It's time now to get to work. He's got a lot of that ahead of him, so it's understandable I suppose if that, not rhetoric, is what is foremost in his mind."

Here is a range of what people are saying. Troy Harlan in Portland Oregon summed it up this way: Dear Sam Cooke, a change has come. A change has come. #inaug09 It was an emotional moment for many on Twitter. Beth in Santa Cruz California said: #inaug09: I love that Obama is nervous and not perfect....yay! The crowd roars and I am still crying here. Duarte Da Silva in Toronto had one word during Obama's speech: Goosebumps! A woman in Chicago said on Twitter: #inaug09 It's a good thing I am wearing water-proof mascara. From Michigan, Twitterer paulina1 said: ""I think im gonna cry..never thought i would get to experience this in my life time..#inaug09"" ... ""I got a tissue. It is a an experience. I am not a complete Obama fan, I am excited for the change."" James Robertson, who lives in Washington DC and might be used to these events, was still wowed. #inaug09 The wide shots from the Capitol are just staggering. Solid people from the Capitol to the Washington Monument. Truly amazing Separation of Church and State There was some upset about the invocation, not only that conservative Pastor Rick Warren gave it, but the fact that it was given at all. However, a Gallup Poll showed that only 10% of Democrats objected to his participation. Twitter users did object. Wesley Williams in Milton Keynes in England said: Seperation of church and state people! Stop with the frickin' prayers! #inaug09 Alex Hew said: ""There is so much wrong with praying at a presidential inauguration #inaug09"" Amy Zimmerman said: ""never like the invocation. i still hold to separation of church and state. no place for religion here for this obama fan #inaug09"" However, many Twitter users took note that Obama described the United States as ""a nation of Christians, Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and non-beleievers"". It was a notable statement for their inclusion and recognition of non-believers or atheists. Millions inspired, hope for healing After Obama's speech, Amy seemed inspired: for the first time since those awful days post 911 we witness a love and pride of country. let this carry over! #inaug09 There was cautious optimism, even amongst those who might not be Obama supporters or members of his party. Gregg Smith said: As a life long Republican I must say I am excited about the future for our country Lisa in Oklahoma noted the anger by Bush supporters towards Obama on Twitter and said: #inaug09 We need to put aside our differences. Obama is going to be our president in just moments. We should stand behind him. Thanks for sharing your comments with us, and thanks for following GuardianUS on Twitter during the elections and the inauguration."
34,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Obama inauguration: Words of history ... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks,• Chief speechwriter known as president's mind reader • Young aide studied past inaugural orations,"When Barack Obama steps up to the podium to deliver his inaugural address, one man standing anonymously in the crowd will be paying especially close attention. With his cropped hair, five o'clock shadow and boyish face, he might look out of place among the dignitaries, though as co-author of the speech this man has more claim than most to be a witness to this moment of history. Jon Favreau, 27, is, as Obama himself puts it, the president's mind reader. He is one of the youngest chief speechwriters on record in the White House, and, despite such youth, was at the centre of discussions of the content of today's speech, one which has so much riding on it. For a politician whose rise to prominence was largely built upon his powers as an orator, Obama is well versed in the arts of speech-making. But today's effort will tower over all previous ones. It is not just that Obama has set an extremely high bar by invoking the inaugural speeches of Abraham Lincoln as his inspiration - admitting to feeling ""intimidated"" when he read them. It is also that, as he begins his term with the US in an economic crisis and two wars, he knows he needs to kick start his presidency with a soaring rhetoric that both moves and motivates the American people. The tone of the speech could be decisive in determining how the public responds to his first 100 days, as Franklin Roosevelt's famous line ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" helped to determine his. Obama aides have let it be known that a key theme will be restoring responsibility - both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Rahm Emanuel, Obama's chief of staff, talks of a ""culture of responsibility"" that would ""not just be asked of the American people; its leaders must also lead by example."" In composing the high notes of the speech, Obama has leant on Favreau, whom he discovered almost by chance four years ago when the younger man was working on John Kerry's failed presidential bid. ""Favs"" has since studied Obama's speech patterns and cadences with the intensity of a stalker. He memorised the 2004 speech to the Democratic national convention which first brought Obama into the limelight. He is said to carry Obama's autobiography, Dreams From My Father, wherever he goes. As a result, last November when Favreau sat down to write the first draft of the inaugural address, he could conjure up his master's voice as if an accomplished impersonator. That skill had been put to almost daily use in the 18 months of brutal campaigning on the presidential trail. Favreau would be up most nights until 3am, honing the next day's stump speeches in a caffeine haze of espressos and Red Bull energy drinks, taking breaks to play the video game Rock Band. He coined a phrase for this late-night deadline surfing: ""crashing"". He crashed his way through all Obama's most memorable speeches. He wrote the draft of one that helped to turn Iowa for Obama while closeted in a coffee shop in Des Moines. For the presidential election, he wrote two speeches: one for a victory, one for defeat. When the result came through, he emailed his best friend: ""Dude, we won. Oh my God."" The tension between such youthful outbursts and his onerous role has sometimes cost the 27-year-old. In December, pictures of him and a friend mocking a cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton at a party, Favreau's hand on her breast, were posted on Facebook to his huge embarrassment. Obama is an accomplished writer in his own right, and the process of drafting with his mind reader is collaborative. The inaugural speech has shuttled between them four or five times, following an initial hour-long meeting in which the president-elect spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on his computer. Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His team interviewed historians and speech writers, studied periods of crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he took up residence in Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first draft. The end result will be uttered on the steps of the Capitol. Obama's mind reader has crashed his way through yet another deadline. • This article was amended on Friday 23 January 2009. Jon Favreau, age 27, is not the youngest chief speechwriter in the White House. He shares that honour with James Fallows, who served as Jimmy Carter's speechwriter at the same age. This has been corrected."
35,2009-01-20T11:10:18Z,News,Gordon Brown may not be first EU leader to meet President Obama,Downing Street spokesman says prime minister 'does not attach too much importance to who has what meetings when',"Gordon Brown may not be the first European leader to meet Barack Obama after he becomes US president, Downing Street indicated today. The prime minister is writing a letter to Obama, congratulating him on entering office and assuring him that Britain ""stands ready to work very closely with his administration on many of the international challenges that we face"", Brown's spokesman told reporters. The prime minister would like to be the first to be invited to the Obama White House. But Downing Street pointed out that Obama is due to come to Britain for a meeting of the G20 world leaders – 19 major economies plus the EU – on 2 April and that Jacques Chirac, the former French president, was the first European leader to meet George Bush, Obama's predecessor. ""We wouldn't attach too much importance to who has what meetings when,"" said the spokesman. ""The important thing is whether or not you share the same values and have similar approaches and are able to work together on challenges."" The spokesman said he was not sure whether the prime minister would be able to watch the inauguration and Obama's first speech as president live on television, but said he would certainly try to see at least part of it at some point today. At this morning's weekly cabinet meeting in Downing Street, Brown told ministers that the government shared ""many of the same values"" as Obama and had adopted a very similar approach on the global economic downturn. Briefing reporters on the cabinet meeting, Brown's spokesman said: ""The prime minister emphasised the importance of working very closely with the incoming US administration. ""He said the government shared many of the same values of President Obama and his team, and is adopting a very similar approach to the positions that the incoming president has been setting out on some of the big global challenges that we face: first and foremost, the economy, where Britain and America are taking similar action to deal with problems in the credit and financial market, and taking a similar approach on fiscal policy."" Brown told the cabinet that his government and Obama's administration ""share a very similar view on the role of the environment"", said the spokesman. And he added: ""We will want to work very closely with the Obama administration on the Middle East, on Iraq and on Afghanistan. ""On the Middle East, we share support for the two-state solution and want to work with the US administration and others for a successful ceasefire."""
36,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Barack Obama's speeches: 2002 to 2006,NA,"First speech on Iraq as President Bush authorises going to war 2 October 2002 Federal Plaza, Chicago I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne. What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics. Keynote address to the 2004 Democratic convention 27 July 2004 Fleet centre, Boston Even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here - the almost wilful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the healthcare crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope! On black community responsibilities 1 May 2005 National Association for Advancement of Colored People, Detroit Our grandparents used to tell us that being black means you have to work twice as hard to succeed in life. And so I ask today, can we honestly say our kids are working twice as hard as the kids in India and China who are graduating ahead of us, with better test scores and the tools they need to kick our butts on the job market? Can we honestly say our teachers are working twice as hard, or our parents? In defence of women's right to choose 10 November 2005 National Women's Law Centre, Washington The other side knows that equal opportunity has always been a winning argument for us. And that's why those who don't want to make it a reality choose to fight on other terms. They make sure that in any given campaign or debate, the only woman's issue that ever comes up is not equal pay or healthcare or family leave, but the narrowest, most divisive issues like late-term abortion. Now, the ability for a woman to make decisions about how many children to have and when - without interference from the government - is one of the most fundamental freedoms we have. We all know, becoming a parent is one of the most - if not the most - important jobs there is. No one should make that decision for a woman and her family but them. And we must keep defending their right to make this choice in the years to come. On ending America's fossil fuel addiction 3 April 2006 Chicago When it comes to finding a way to end our dependence on fossil fuels, the greatest vacuum in leadership, the biggest failure of imagination, and the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change is coming from the very people who are running the country. By now, the Bush administration's record on climate change is almost legendary. This is the administration that commissioned government experts and scientists to do a study on global warming, only to omit the part from the final report that said it was caused by humans. This is the administration that didn't try to improve the Kyoto Treaty by trying to include oil guzzlers like China and India, but walked away from the entire global effort to stem climate change. And just recently, this is the administration that tried to silence a Nasa scientist for letting the rest of us know that yes, climate change is a pretty big deal ... This is not a serious effort. Saying that America is addicted to oil without following a real plan for energy independence is like admitting alcoholism and then skipping out on the 12-step program. It's not enough to identify the challenge - we have to meet it. The challenge of going into politics, with 'that funny name' 11 May 2006 Emily's List annual lunch, Washington I remember when I first ran for the state senate - my very first race. A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running. Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife. And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen. I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature. And everywhere I went I'd get two questions: First, they'd ask, ""Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?"" Because people just couldn't pronounce it. They'd call me ""Alabama,"" or they'd call me ""Yo Mama"". And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya. And the second thing people would ask me was, ""You seem like a nice young man. You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organise voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"" On the embarrassment of his first Democratic convention 2 June 2006 University of Massachusetts, Boston It's always great to be back in Boston. As some of you may have heard, I was here a few years ago to give the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention. It was an amazing experience for me. A humbling honour. A tremendous opportunity. And if you had come up to me a few years earlier and told me I'd be there, I would've politely told you that you were out of your mind. Let me tell you what happened at the last convention I had been to. It was the year 2000, and I had just gotten my rear-end handed to me in my very first race for Congress. Didn't even make it past the primary. I was a little depressed, and more than a little broke, but some friends suggested that I get my mind off it by going to Los Angeles, where that year's Democratic convention was being held. So I decided to go. And when my plane landed in LA, I got my luggage, walked on over to the Hertz counter, filled out all the forms to rent a car, gave my credit card to the nice woman behind the counter who, moments later, handed it back to me and said, ""Mr Obama, it seems we have a problem."" That's right, my credit card was denied. After 30 more minutes of haggling, I finally made it to the convention, only to learn that I was thought of so highly by the Democratic party that my credentials barely granted me access to the men's room - let alone backstage where all the action was. And so, being the VIP that I was, I spent the rest of the week as the guy in the room who nobody knew, but everyone knew didn't belong. Needless to say, when they asked me to be the convention's keynote speaker just four years later, I made sure I was getting a car. All joking aside, receiving that honour was a welcome change - and, as MasterCard could attest, more than a little unlikely."
37,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion,My fellow Americans,What paragraph would you like to sneak into Obama's inauguration speech today?,"Jeffrey Sachs: An end to extreme poverty Our generation's unique challenge is to live peacefully and sustainably on a crowded planet. I commit America to work with all the world to end extreme poverty in our generation, convert to sustainable energy and ecosystem use, and stabilise the world's population by 2050, before our numbers and resource demands overwhelm the planet and our fragile capacity to co-operate. Our wars are distractions from these challenges; today's enemies will become tomorrow's partners in shared prosperity. Hans Blix: No more arms races The cold war ended nearly 20 years ago. We and our adversaries no longer target each other. More and more we need to join hands to tackle threats facing the whole world: financial disarray, climate change, diseases, nuclear proliferation, and terrorists or governments acting erratically. The US must remain militarily strong but will gain in security and save sorely needed resources by avoiding new arms races and reaching global agreements on arms control. Patricia Williams: Let science inform faith It is my profound hope that in the years to come, we may find ourselves united in love of our shared home, not only defence of the homeland; in reverence for the constitution, not merely obeisance to the nation-state; in collaborative debate as well as decisive action; and in peace, not only pacification. Let us also ensure that science informs our faith, and that our faith not be blind to the rich diversity of community and human need. Benjamin Barber: Creating opportunity in crisis In the midst of crisis, we can prime the credit pump and push consumers back into the mall. Or we can turn the fiscal disaster into an opportunity to change habits and attitudes and create a new and green sustainable economy; encourage saving not spending; invest in education and culture; lower energy consumption and slow growth; give government help to homeowners and job-holders, rather than banks and corporations. We should put our pain to the purposes of birthing a new democratic civil society in which the economy serves us, not the other way round. Pankaj Mishra: Influence trumps force In international affairs, I will always bear in mind the words of George Kennan, neglected prophet of cold war America, who believed our nation would exercise its greatest influence by manifesting civilised values rather than by trying to impose them on others through military force: any message we try to bring to others will be effective only if it is in accord with what we are to ourselves, and if this is something sufficiently impressive to compel the respect and confidence of a world which, despite all its material difficulties, is still more ready to recognise and respect spiritual distinction than material opulence. Jayati Ghosh: A commitment to peaceful multilateralism I commit my administration to peaceful multilateralism. Politically, the US will not resort to military intervention until all other solutions have been explored. I will work for lasting and just peace in the Middle East, beginning with quick action to stop the carnage in Gaza. Economically, we will strongly back international moves to regulate finance, to make trade less unequal and to allow greater policy autonomy for developing countries. My government's fiscal stimulus package will be oriented to making production and consumption patterns within the US more sustainable and will address problems of excessive resource use and climate change. John Pilger: Redress for criminal wars My fellow human beings, I pledge on this historic day that the US will cease its multiple acts of aggression against humanity and withdraw immediately from Iraq, Afghanistan and 770 military bases around the world. I will instruct the international criminal court that the US no longer shuns its authority and have instructed that 30 names from the Bush administration be submitted for immediate prosecution. Saffron Burrows: Just treatment for prisoners Much can be known about a country by the way it treats its prisoners. If there is a disparity between the values that we say we stand for and our actions internationally then we have become a dissonant society that does not practise what it preaches. We must stand for what we believe in: a society that cares about all people. There can be no reconciliation with and redemption for those we have inhumanely incarcerated, wrongfully imprisoned and tortured without truth-telling and justice. Only then will we have the energy to go forward and, by example, work to shift the world in real ways because we have clean hands. Joe Queenan: We all have to accept blame for the financial crisis Right here and now I'd like you all to stop placing all the blame for the current mess on my predecessor. Every last one of you who bought a house in the past 10 years knew that the whole thing was a scam, that the inflated value of your house was the result of the subprime con-job. Every single one of you who invested in the stockmarket knew the whole thing was a house of cards, that when stocks are trading at 40 times current earnings the market is rigged. Every last one of you tolerated George Bush when he made you rich, just as our British friends tolerated Maggie Thatcher and Tony Blair and only turned against them when things started to go south. The fault lies not in the stars nor in the yellow rose of Texas, dear Brutus. It lies in us. Eric Hobsbawm: A Middle East resolution Although it will be difficult to make a decisive break with the policies of the past administration in the Middle East, I intend to do so. Without a solution to the Palestinian problem, no stable or promising future in this region will be possible, including long-term security for Israel. I hope my Jewish fellow Americans recognise that the major obstacle to such a solution is the unwillingness of Israel to accept a viable Palestinian state. Since Israel is largely dependent on the US, I propose to exercise pressure to change Israel's policies. Rebecca Solnit: Change must come from all And to the people who brought me to the presidency: remember that it was your power that gave me mine and that it is now your task not to surrender that power, either by believing that I will do the work of forming a more perfect union and a more just society for you, or by believing that your goal has been accomplished. I will be your president, but you must be my civil society, pushing me onward to the radical changes we need to make. Hope in me, but do not trust me; make me. Robin Morgan: Without justice for women, there is justice for none I would like to affirm the words of my new secretary of state at her confirmation hearings: of particular concern to me is the plight of women – the majority of the world's unhealthy, unschooled, unfed and unpaid. Violence against women, within their families and from the outside: this is not culture. This is not custom. This is criminal. If half the world's population remains vulnerable to economic, political, legal, and social marginalisation, our hope of advancing democracy and prosperity is in serious jeopardy. The US must be an unequivocal, unwavering voice in support of women's rights in every country on every continent. David Landau: Impose a two-state solution After 1967, the Arab mainstream said: no peace, no recognition, no negotiations. The Israeli mainstream said: no PLO state, no ""internationalisation of the conflict"", no imposed solution. Five of those noes have gone. They've become the province of extremists, enemies of peace. These very days, Israel urges the return of PLO rule to Gaza, and of international forces to its border. My administration, committed to Israel's security and to Palestinian independence, will use its best endeavours to impose a solution – the two-state solution that all sane people want – on the two nations. And I will expect and assist both to impose it on their respective enemies of peace. Michael Tomasky: Leading by moral example To the rest of the world, I say that we are your friend. The US has been most successful when it has led by moral example, not by coercion or force. In the coming years we will hew to this standard. I am as resolved to isolate and defeat our enemies as any American could be - no one should misunderstand that - we will do that best when we adhere to our highest principles; that's when the people of the world will see most clearly that our way - freedom of speech and worship, equality for women, the rule of law - is the best way, and the people of America will see those striving people across the world as brothers and sisters in the fight for liberty and dignity. Bonnie Greer: The lesson of Lassie A joke the late, great Lenny Bruce used to tell is: ""What's the difference - in a movie - between Lassie and a black man? At the end of the movie, Lassie lives."" In other words, the dog who didn't talk got a chance to serve another day. That's the way it was, and there are many of you in this audience today who know the deep meaning of Bruce's joke, and who know what I mean. Now I can't say that that movie is quite over yet... but the credits are well and truly rolling! Bethany McLean: Seek economic development, not fraud and fiction The conventional wisdom is that more regulation and better ethics would have prevented this economic apocalypse. But it's a mistake to believe that either one offers perfect protection. In the wake of Enron, Congress enacted new rules. Sarbanes Oxley did nothing to prevent the current crisis, because regulation tends to be a modern Maginot line. As for the oxymoron of corporate ethics, put faith in that at your peril. What might work? Change the incentives. Reward our business leaders when they build companies that are successful over the long term. Make it more difficult for fortunes to be made on the backs of short-term profits that turn out to be totally illusory. Then you might get real economic development, not fraud and fiction. Jonathan Farley: It is time to re-imagine America America is today something the Founding Fathers could never imagine. It is not enough to say we will torture no more. We won't. It is not enough to say Guantánamo must close. It will. It is not enough to say no more wars based on lies. Those wars will end. But these are things we stand against. What do we stand for? Free healthcare, for all. Free education, for all. A living wage for honest work. The development of wind and solar power. The shoring-up of our infrastructure. It is time to re-imagine America."
38,2009-01-20T13:25:43Z,News,'Barack is our son': Kenyans celebrate their US president,"• Thousands gather in hope of respite from domestic problems• Schools, sports teams and beers named in Obama's honour","He may be the about to become the 44th president of the US, but today Kenyans have been celebrating Barack Obama's inauguration as if he were their own leader. In Kogelo, the village in western Kenya where Obama's father grew up, primary school classrooms have been converted into makeshift hotels with names such as Mama Sister, Something Cold and Connie of Siaya, selling tea, chapatti and popcorn. In the playground the commotion came not from children but male traditional dancers wearing pink and blue sisal skirts, large feathers on their arms and, in the case of one elderly man, a cloak made of the silky black and white fur of a colobus monkey. Loudspeakers broadcast speeches by the man whose achievement many hundreds of people had come to revel in today. ""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old maths teacher at the Barack Obama primary school. ""He is our son."" And not just a village son, or even a son of the Luo ethnic group, but a child of the entire country, judging by the parties taking place across Kenya. Along the coast, hotels have organised night-long ""Yes We Did"" bashes, while in the capital, Nairobi, where special Obama prayer services are scheduled for this afternoon, bars are anticipating one of the busiest nights of the year. In western towns such as Kakamega and Kisumu, tens of thousands of people are expected to watch the inauguration on giant screens – and forget about the grand corruption scandals and looming famine in their own country. ""Everybody is dwelling on the Obama victory,"" said Jael Lieta, a 24-year-old radio presenter in Kisumu. ""It is a great chance to take a break from the bad news in Kenya."" It is also a chance to make money. The country's biggest brewer, which already has a brand of beer called Senator, has launched a special edition President lager. A mobile phone company is selling one-off Yes We Can handsets. In Nairobi, a hospitality institute has been advertising for new students by declaring: ""Obamamania is set to grow Kenya's tourism industry – this is change you can believe in"". It is true that Kogelo, home to about 5,000 people, has already become a sightseeing attraction for foreigner visitors. Signs for ""tourist hotels"" have sprung up along the main road since November's election result. With a planned museum yet to be built, the only real sight is the home of Obama's grandmother Mama Sarah, who, along with several other close relatives, has travelled to the inauguration in Washington. A group of camera-toting South Korean students seemed devastated to hear this, only for the police guarding the house to enter into the party spirit by allowing them a brief look around the property. A short walk up the road at the primary school, vendors hawked commemorative T-shirts, caps, calendars, traditional print wraps and lapel badges with slogans such as ""Obama the 44th"". After buying a badge, Vitalis Omondi, 36, said: ""I never believed that Bush would agree to leave office and allow Obama in – that doesn't happen here."" A publishing company was selling a locally written biography of Obama for £2.50. Nearby a photographer had set up a stall selling framed photographic portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is also from the region. Students at the adjacent secondary school had arrived for class in their neat blue and white uniforms, but were soon released from their lessons. George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study, was among a group of boys rushing towards the primary school football field where Obama FC was about to take to the pitch. ""By becoming US president Obama has given us all hope,"" he said. ""If you believe something then you can do it."" Otieno's dream is to become a lawyer, and he is hoping the Obama presidency will help him get a scholarship to a US university. The expectation that Kogelo, and Kenya more broadly, will receive a boost from Washington in the form of grants and favours over the next four years is not an uncommon sentiment among ordinary people. Writing in the Nation newspaper today, the columnist Macharia Gaitho said that while Kenyans were celebrating louder than the American ""owners of the party"", these types of expectations needed to be lowered. ""True, he [Obama] does have an attachment to the country,"" he wrote, ""but it would be foolish of us to wait for him to direct Air Force 1 [sic] and the entire American fleet to bring goodies to our starving shores."""
39,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Barack Obama's speeches: 2006 to February 2008,NA,"The 'Take back America' speech 14 June 2006 Washington Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time. Our time to make a mark on history. Our time to write a new chapter in the American story. Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up. And then some day, some day, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose. They can say that this was the time when America found its way. They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again. Recollections of his father, while visiting Kenya 28 August 2006 University of Nairobi The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987. I had just finished three years of work as a community organiser in low-income neighbourhoods of Chicago, and was about to enrol in law school. My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month. My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip. Instead of a motorcade, we travelled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already 10 years old. When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road. I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi. When we went upcountry, we travelled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap. But it was a magical trip. To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty. I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left. And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him. I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called ""boy"" by his employers for most of his life. I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the ""Pipeline"" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles. I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult. I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had travelled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya. In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early 60s, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation. And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments. His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years. And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well. Statement to the Senate on homeland security 27 September 2006 Washington The vast majority of the folks in Guantánamo, I suspect, are there for a reason. There are a lot of dangerous people. Particularly dangerous are people like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Ironically, those are the guys who are going to get real military procedures because they are going to be charged by the government. But detainees who have not committed war crimes - or where the government's case is not strong - may not have any recourse whatsoever. The bottom line is this: current procedures under the CSRT [combatant status review tribunals] are such that a perfectly innocent individual could be held and could not rebut the government's case and has no way of proving his innocence. I would like somebody in this chamber, somebody in this government, to tell me why this is necessary. I do not want to hear that this is a new world and we face a new kind of enemy. I know that. I know that every time I think about my two little girls and worry for their safety - when I wonder if I really can tuck them in at night and know that they are safe from harm. I have as big of a stake as anybody on the other side of the aisle and anybody in this administration in capturing terrorists and incapacitating them. I would gladly take up arms myself against any terrorist threat to make sure my family is protected. But as a parent, I can also imagine the terror I would feel if one of my family members were rounded up in the middle of the night and sent to Guantánamo without even getting one chance to ask why they were being held and being able to prove their innocence. This is not just an entirely fictional scenario, by the way. We have already had reports by the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantánamo should not have been there. As one US commander of Guantánamo told the Wall Street Journal: ""Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks."" Global summit on Aids and the church 1 December 2006 Saddleback church campus, California I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren. Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by Aids, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do. Their decision to devote their time, their money and their purpose-driven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and Aids. The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease. Statement to the Senate on the Iraq war de-escalation act 30 January 2007 Washington Mr President, today in Iraq we sadly find ourselves at the very point I feared most when I opposed giving the president the open-ended authority to wage this war in 2002 - an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the midst of a country torn by civil war. The American people have waited and the American people have been patient. We have given chance after chance for a resolution that has not come, and, more importantly, watched with horror and grief the tragic loss of thousands of brave young American soldiers. The time for waiting in Iraq is over. The days of our open-ended commitment must come to a close. And the need to bring this war to an end is here. Announcement of entry to Democratic presidential race 10 February 2007 Springfield, Illinois Let me tell you how I came to be here. As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state. I moved to Illinois over two decades ago. I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections. But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organiser for $13,000 a year. And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America. My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighbourhoods. I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closures. I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill. It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith. After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need. I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate. It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state senator. It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and labourers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamouring to be heard. I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today ... It was here, in Springfield, where north, south, east and west come together, that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America. And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still live, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States. 'Super Tuesday' Democratic race election-night speech 5 February 2008 Chicago What began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the corn fields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers, students and seniors stood up in numbers we've never seen. They stood up to say that maybe this year, we don't have to settle for a politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems. This time we can finally do something about healthcare we can't afford or mortgages we can't pay. This time can be different. Their voices echoed from the hills of New Hampshire to the deserts of Nevada, where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe Washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists any more. They reached the coast of South Carolina when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender; that crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children; that we can come together and build an America that gives every child, everywhere, the opportunity to live their dreams. This time can be different. And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states north and south, east and west, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change. A chorus that cannot be ignored. That cannot be deterred. This time can be different because this campaign for the presidency is different. It's different not because of me, but because of you. Because you are tired of being disappointed and tired of being let down. You're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to Washington. Because the lobbyists just write another cheque. Or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should. Or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters."
40,2009-01-20T17:20:42Z,News,Obama's inauguration provokes tepid response in Russia,NA,"Today's inauguration of Barack Obama provoked a lukewarm response in Russia, with state television covering the event patchily, and the only public displays of attention breaking out in overtly expatriate venues. 'I don't think the relationship between our countries will change greatly,' Igor Krasavin, 28, a philosophy lecturer from Yekaterinburg predicted after the speech. He added, however: 'Personally I like him.' Most Russians appear to agree - praising his 'powerful' delivery but also noting he looked a bit nervous, especially at the beginning. They were generally optimistic that Obama would now bring positive changes, though. 'I expect him to practice a greener kind of politics,' Konstantin Zgurovsky, 56, an ecologist said. 'I think he will pay greater attention to domestic problems and pull the US army out of Iraq.' Others were more equivocal. 'Unquestionably there will be changes. But what they are we still don't know yet. I hope he quickly resolves the US's crisis, so that Russia's economic problems become easier,' Tatyana Bazlova, 27, from Pskov said. There was also general agreement that the 44th president could only be an improvement on the disastrous 43rd - seen in Russia, as elsewhere, as a warmonger. Obama's speech was seen by many as a direct repudiation of the Bush legacy. 'I hope that Obama means that Russia and the US develop a pragmatic partnership. I hope Obama prefers to use his intelligence rather than war as a means of influence,' Alena Pravidla, 31, from Moscow noted."
41,2009-01-20T17:47:22Z,News,Iraqis wary of US president's message of change,Barack Obama's inauguration speech fails to resonate in country that will help shape legacy of his first years in office,"Many Iraqis seemed nonplussed at the swearing-in of Barack Obama, with some not knowing the inauguration was taking place and others consumed by the fallout from the previous presidency. President Obama's messages of change and remaking America have yet to resonate in the country that will help shape the legacy of his first years in office. Some Baghdadis were however impressed by his inauguration speech. ""If he can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over,"" said Abu Ali, the owner of a sparkling new restaurant, Shisha Cafe, in the city's Karada district. ""I believe he is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests,"" he added. ""That's it."" Another cafe-goer, Haitham Sarkis, said his family had long ago stopped listening to Obama's predecessor George Bush and become dispirited by his last three years in office. ""He kept telling us one thing, yet we were living the other,"" he said. ""This man never knew us and we are left with a massive mess that we must now pick up – not the new president."" The US presence on the streets of Baghdad may be slowly diminishing, but the withdrawal of the occupying forces is not generating a rise in America's popularity. Iraqi children and youths regularly taunt each other by removing their shoes and threatening to throw them – mimicking the local journalist who humiliated Bush during his last visit in December. ""Obama won't get the same treatment,"" said a nurse from the northern suburb of Adamiyeh, Um Nassir. ""But he won't have too long to prove himself to us."" Bush, however, is not a villain to all. ""He always said history will judge him,"" said parliamentarian Samira Musawi. ""But God will judge him as well and God has used Bush to remove the evil of Saddam and set the Iraqi nation free. It is now our responsibility to find the right way to direct this change."""
42,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Barack Obama's speeches: February 2008 to election night,NA,"'Potomac Primary' election night 12 February 2008 Madison, Wisconsin Now when I start talking like this, some folks tell me that I've got my head in the clouds. That I need a reality check. That we're still offering false hope. But my own story tells me that in the United States of America, there has never been anything false about hope. I should not be here today. I was not born into money or status. I was born to a teenage mom in Hawaii, and my dad left us when I was two. But my family gave me love, they gave me education, and most of all they gave me hope - hope that in America, no dream is beyond our grasp if we reach for it, and fight for it, and work for it ... The politics of hope does not mean hoping things come easy. Because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody, somewhere, stood up when it was hard; stood up when they were told, ""No, you can't"", and said, ""Yes, we can."" 'The race speech' after the Reverend Wright controversy 18 March 2008 Philadelphia Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either ""too black"" or ""not black enough"". We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarisation, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation; that rightly offend white and black alike. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely - just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic healthcare crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all ... For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races. In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don't feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. They've worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labour. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighbourhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren't always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talkshow hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle-class squeeze - a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favour the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognising they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. Final primary night: presumptive Democratic nominee speech 3 June 2008 St Paul, Minnesota Tonight, after 54 hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. Thousands of miles have been travelled. Millions of voices have been heard. And because of what you said - because you decided that change must come to Washington; because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest; because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another - a journey that will bring a new and better day to America. Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. At this defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office. I have not just competed with them as rivals, I have learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better. They are leaders of this party, and leaders that America will turn to for years to come. That is particularly true for the candidate who has travelled further on this journey than anyone else. Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she's a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because she's a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. We've certainly had our differences over the last 16 months. But our party and our country are better off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honour to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Acceptance speech at the Democratic convention 28 August 2008 Mile High stadium, Denver We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush. America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work. This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough ..."" You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI bill. In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States. Election night victory speech 4 November 2008 Grant Park, Chicago If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer ... I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organised, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth. This is your victory ... The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America - I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you - we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years - block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. • Edited speeches reprinted courtesy of Obama for America, the official website of the Barack Obama election campaign (barackobama.com).

43,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Obama's inbox,"The new president's concerns in the coming months - the top priorities, the key players, and the risks","Wars Top priority Obama will meet military chiefs tomorrow to discuss how to withdraw US troops from Iraq and win the war in Afghanistan. He is committed to a big reduction in the 140,000-plus US troops in Iraq within 18 months and to send an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. Pentagon sources have reported that Obama's team were shocked that problems attached to both wars were worse than anticipated. Key player Defence secretary Robert Gates is liked in the Pentagon for having brought order and pragmatism back to the department. The ""surge"" policy, in which an extra 30,000 US troops were sent to Iraq in 2007, was implemented by General David Petraeus but it was the brainchild of Gates. He now has to try to pacify Afghanistan. Risks A Pentagon source said last week that if the Iranians had planted a covert unit in the Bush administration, they could not have done a better job than ex-defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz. The Iranian influence in Iraq and Afghanistan grows daily. If the US pulls out 60,000 troops from Iraq within 16 months, 80,000 will still be left, which will disappoint those who want a total pullout. Economy Top priority Obama's economic team has been holding regular sessions but tomorrow they will gather for the first time in the White House. There is only so long they will be able to blame the recession on the Bush administration. They are proposing a spending bill along the lines of Roosevelt's New Deal, designed to create three to four million jobs. The latest estimate for the package is $800bn (about £540bn). Key player As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Tim Geithner, now head of the Treasury, was at the centre of many of the Wall Street crises last year. He now has to implement a plant to prevent the US falling into the worst recession since the 1930s. He has got off to a bad start, with the revelation that he failed to pay his taxes, which has slowed his US Senate confirmation hearings. Risks The obvious one is that the stimulus package will not work. Bush brought in tax cuts to encourage spending and it made almost no difference. If Obama's handling of the economy fails, the Democrats could be punished in Congressional elections at the end of next year and in 2012 he could end up as a one-term president. Republicans in Congress are complaining about the scale of public spending. Environment Top priority Obama has promised to implement fuel-efficiency policies, reduce US dependence on foreign oil and take steps to tackle global warming. Some of the spending from the stimulus package is to be diverted to development of environment-friendly technologies. One of the main tests is whether Obama signs up to an agreement on emissions to replace the Kyoto protocol Key player Stephen Chu, the physicist and Nobel Prize winner, who will run the energy department, has criticised the use of coal and nuclear power. He has warned of ""dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate system"" if the US and other countries refuse to reduce greenhouse gases. He has to implement election promises to cut emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050 Risks The recession may not allow Obama and Chu to spend as much on energy projects as they had hoped. There is scepticism too about whether wind, solar and other alternative power sources are capable of offering a significant replacement for current energy sources. Chu, before being nominated for the energy job, had been an advocate of higher US taxes on petrol, but that is likely to be heard less often. Foreign policy Top priority Obama's plan to restore the US reputation in the world after eight years of the Bush administration should be relatively easy, with goodwill flowing his way. Harder though will be dealing with the foreign policy challenges confronting him, from the Israel-Palestinian conflict to Iran, North Korea and Pakistan. He could announce the appointment of a special Middle East envoy tomorrow. Key player As US senator for New York, Hillary Clinton positioned herself as a close friend of Israel and adopted aggressive rhetoric towards Iran. But as first lady, she called for an independent Palestinian state when it was not administration policy. She is almost certain to mix a threat of tougher economic sanctions against Iran with an offer of direct talks. Relations with Europe will almost certainly be much better. Risks There is a strong chance Iran will resist US overtures. The US could probably live with a nuclear-armed Iran but Israel may not, and an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear plants would create havoc. One big worry is Pakistan and the danger that the instability in Afghanistan will spill over the border. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is almost certain to continue to defy the best efforts of outside diplomats. Domestic policy Top priority Obama has promised to tackle health and education, decrying the state of public schools and the lack of health care, not just for the poorest but many working-class families. He has appointed Arne Duncan, a friend from Chicago days with a reputation for toughness, to reform education. Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader, will be deputed to extend the inadequate health insurance umbrella. Key player Rahm Emmanuel, White House chief of staff, will have to push through Congress policies the Republicans regard as contentious. Emmanuel is a bruiser and his abrasive style could prove counterproductive in relations with Republican members of Congress. And there could be hot-tempered exchanges with members of the cabinet, advisers and departmental officials. Risks The biggest problem is that the economic stimulus package, though vast, could mean funds Obama had anticipated for health care and education might have to be cut back. Reforms in health and education may turn out to be less than the sweeping ones he pledged and instead become incremental, with promises do to more in a second term. That would be a problem when he seeks re-election."
44,2009-01-20T21:34:16Z,News,Wall Street shares plunge on Obama's inauguration day,NA,"Wall Street provided an unwelcome reminder of the financial challenge facing Barack Obama as it marked the new president's inauguration with a stock market plunge led down by a renewed crisis of confidence in US banks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst one-day drop since December 1, slumping by 332 points to 7,949. It was the blue-chip index's first fall below 8,000 since November and all 30 Dow components were in the red by the end of the day. Britain's struggle to bail out banks aggravated fresh soul-searching on transatlantic markets over the viability of leading US institutions without significant further public aid. A disclosure of huge potential losses at Boston-based State Street contributed to the rout. Bank of America, under pressure over its takeover of loss-making Merrill Lynch, saw its shares dive by 29%. JP Morgan dropped 21%, Citigroup lost 20%, Wells Fargo slid by 24% and Goldman Sachs fell 19%. It was the worst inauguration day in US history for stock prices according to figures compiled by Bloomberg and the Stock Traders' Almanac, with none of Washington's optimism spilling through to the financial sector. The new president's inaugural speech briefly lifted shares, although they tumbled downwards as the afternoon progressed. Obama reasserted his desire for tougher regulation, saying that the present crisis was a reminder that ""without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control"". Anxious traders compared the gathering sense of foreboding to the near panic which swept through markets in September in the weeks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. ""The market doesn't trust that banks have properly marked their balance sheets and their loan portfolios,"" said Robert Patten, a banking analyst at Morgan Keegan. ""The sense is that there are further marks to come, that tangible book [value] is not as it is stated today."" The money management firm State Street became the latest firm to be dragged into the mire as it revealed unrealised investment losses of $10bn on instruments such as commercial paper – short-term debt issued by companies. State Street, which has 28,000 staff worldwide, announced a 71% slump in quarterly profits to $65m and the company's shares dived by 59%. Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said investors were ""spooked"" by the 217-year-old firm's predicament: ""For State Street, this is the worst news we've ever seen in a day by far."" Standard &amp; Poor's cut its credit rating on State Street, which had hitherto been viewed as one of the healthier of America's major financial institutions. Underlining the severity of the change in market sentiment, the VIX index of volatility, known as Wall Street's ""fear index"", leapt by 22% to 56.39 – its highest since mid-December. The economist Nouriel Roubini, who was credited with foreseeing the present crisis, told a conference in Dubai that losses in the US financial system could hit $3.6tn before the credit crunch ends – which, he said, means the entire US banking system is effectively bankrupt. ""If that's true, it means the US banking system is effectively insolvent because it starts with a capital of $1.4tn,"" said Roubini. ""This is a systemic banking crisis."""
45,2009-01-20T21:25:11Z,Opinion,The president needs our help,"Barack Obama is determined to make his promises a reality. But as he made it clear in his speech today, he cannot do it alone","President Obama's inaugural speech was practical and philosophical, ambitious yet humble – a speech that paid homage to the past while also looking forward. Obama spent less time talking about the specific civil rights history that paved the way for his presidency than one might have expected, although he didn't really have to press the point: hearing and seeing an African American man taking the presidential oath, in addition to witnessing the millions of people of all races and nationalities who stood side by side in support of him was evidence enough of that. If anyone needed reminding though, the poignancy of the fact that ""a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before [us] to take a most sacred oath"" was not lost on anyone. Obama's references to change and hope – the themes that resonated so strongly with American voters during the campaign – were firmly grounded in the serious challenges that he and the country face as he steps into his new role. He is well aware that he has inherited a malfunctioning economy and destructive international conflicts which are yet to be resolved and that must be handled with extreme care. ""The challenges we face are real,"" he starkly warned. He seemed unafraid, however. Despite criticisms that his speech is lofty and his goals over-ambitious, his determination to make a reality of everything that he has promised is clear. He also made it clear during his speech, however, that he cannot do it alone. Most significantly, you see, underpinning President Obama's inaugural speech was a call to action to American people. ""For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies,"" the new president said. In every reference made to the past and in every plan and vision set out for the future, Obama emphasised his view that the progress of America and any forthcoming change is – and has always been – as much about the American people, the nature of American society and the values and ideals that underpin it as it is about the nation's government. For Obama this means a more responsible America, which as a nation has a less arrogant way of dealing with the world and doesn't take its greatness for granted or misuse its power. It goes without saying that there are many in the world – Obama talked specifically about the Muslim world in his speech – who will have been pleased to hear that and are looking forward to seeing America take that new approach, which is so markedly different from the aggressive ways of George Bush. This also means a more thoughtful and reflective American individual who will continue to ""take in a stranger when the levees break … and who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job."" Obama's campaign was built on people power and today he made it clear that it is that same power that will help lead America, under his presidency, become an even greater nation. He is also, unlike his predecessor whose legacy is considered to be overwhelmingly negative, deeply concerned about the America that will be left to future generations. The actions and attitudes of this generation matter to him and it is time for this generation of Americans to ""reaffirm [America's] enduring spirit; to choose our better history"". The generation that Obama has touched and impacted in such a monumental way during his campaign is the one that he now needs to continue in its desire for values-based action, and to also live a values-based life, in order to make significant progress. For the next four years, America – and the world – will watch Obama in action. Whether or not he is able to deliver the change he has promised and whether or not his actions will please the American people remains to be seen. The success of his presidency will be determined primarily by how he deals with the current circumstances that America finds itself in. However, as I stood in the crowd today, listening to Obama speaking, I heard a president who is thoughtful, reflective, conscious and aware while also pragmatic – ""the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works"" and grounded in reality. He knows it is whether or not his government works, and not just his words of inspiration, that will determine his success. This president told the world today that he is determined to ensure that both he, his team of officials and the people that he leads are different – and better – than that of the past. He wants to lead, and he wants Americans to work with him on that. This generation has as much responsibility in the future of America as the new government does. And that can only be a good thing."
46,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Magical spell that will open a new American era,NA,"Today a magic spell will be performed. A man who 12 weeks ago was a mere political candidate will be transformed with the incantation of a few words, before a vast crowd and a television audience in the hundreds of millions if not billions, into the head of state, even the embodiment, of the most powerful nation on earth. It is an act of political alchemy that happens every time a new president is inaugurated, but rarely has the moment been as anticipated as this one. Washington DC, usually a city of strait-laced, sober-suited types has acquired the atmosphere of a child's bedroom in the first hours of Christmas morning. There are snow flurries outside, tacky decorations everywhere - and the resolve to wake up early, so as not to miss a moment of the great day. The excitement is intense and has been building for days, increasing with each coachload of newcomers that arrives in the city. Women wear woolly hats against the cold, the word OBAMA spelled out in diamante letters. Street-hawkers sell T-shirts bearing Obama's face, alongside ever more grandiose slogans. One shows a beatific president-to-be under the quasi-biblical declaration: ""And he shall be called Barack Obama."" The street merchandise, the nightly parties, the rare sighting of Hollywood A-listers among the policy wonks and thinktankers - that happens every four years. But no one would deny the extra fervour this time. The most obvious explanation is written on the faces of African-Americans who have travelled so far to be here. ""This moment won't come again,"" said Robert Davis, 63, who had travelled from Cincinnati, Ohio. ""There may be another black American president, but this will always be the first time."" He was part of the throng at the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, destination for many of those who have come to see Barack Obama sworn in. Perhaps it was a way to place their desire to witness history in a historical context - close to the monument to the president who ended slavery, the site where Martin Luther King declared his dream of equality. In this, the fates have once again helped endow Obama's inauguration with an epic quality. He accepted the Democratic party's presidential nomination on the 45th anniversary, to the day, of the ""I have a dream"" speech. Yesterday, the day before Obama's installation as president, was Martin Luther King day. It added to the sense that America will today reach some kind of fulfilment, even redemption. ""King's dream became a reality,"" said Davis, his voice wavering in the cold. But it is not only black America's pride in Obama that is lending extra magic to today's act of sorcery. For one thing, there is the sheer eagerness to see the back of the present incumbent, George W Bush, who marked a ""mostly private"" last day in office yesterday by granting a cluster of pardons and making a series of goodbye calls to world leaders. No president has left office with lower approval ratings. For another, it is the fact that today's inauguration ceremony will not need to deploy too much magical power to persuade Americans to see Barack Obama as their president. Proof of that is palpable in his dizzyingly high poll ratings, with 79% optimistic about the next four years, according to the New York Times, a degree of goodwill that trumps the numbers that greeted the previous five presidents. The same poll found high levels of hope among those who voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain. It's partly because he has, in the three months of transition, done much to reassure them, appointing solid, centrist figures, including more than one Republican, to key positions. Last night he was due to attend three private dinners honouring the public service of his vice-president-to-be, Joe Biden, and Republicans Colin Powell and McCain himself. But it's also because the new president does seem blessed with the poise and stature that befits a head of state. Yesterday he again looked the part, visiting wounded soldiers at the Walter Reed army medical centre, then rolling up his sleeves and helping paint the walls at a homeless shelter for teenagers in north-east Washington - with Martin Luther King's son at his side. Obama had urged his vast email database of supporters to follow his lead and engage in a day of community service. Among those heeding the call was Michelle Obama who, with her daughters, went to Washington's RFK stadium to join 15,000 volunteers in assembling ""care packages"" for US soldiers serving abroad. But, in a visit to the Calvin Coolidge high school, Obama said that this could not be a ""one-day affair"". He added: ""If we're waiting for someone else to do something, it never gets done."" That prefigures what is set to be one of Obama's major themes today: responsibility, the notion that government cannot solve America's vast problems alone, that everyone has to pitch in. That fits nicely with Obama's insistence that he will be able to work no miracles as president; that tackling the deepening economic crisis will be the stuff of long, hard work. The polls suggest Americans understand that. They know there will be no overnight fix. And they applaud their incoming president for saying so. Indeed, his caution and realism only make them admire him more. Such are the paradoxes of a man who insists he is no magician - but who will stand today at the centre of something magical."
47,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,The making of a president,"Since the Democratic convention in 2000, when his accreditation 'barely granted him access to the men's room', Barack Obama has proved himself one of the great political orators, seamlessly combining complex argument with poignant personal reflection. As the world awaits today's inaugural address, Simon Schama introduces highlights of the new president's finest speechesRead the extracts from Obama's speeches:2002-2006 | 2006-Feb 2008 | Feb 2008-election night","What is it about Illinois? Between Lincoln and Obama there was Everett Dirksen, US Senator in the 1950s and 60s whose LP of Great American Speeches was a fixture for the well-educated, historically minded middle-class library, where it sat alongside bound volumes of American Heritage magazine. Dirksen, Senate minority leader in the age of JFK and LBJ, was a combative conservative but he was not a bigot. It was he who corralled enough Republican votes to make Johnson's civil rights bills filibuster-proof in 1965. So in some sense, the Obama phenomenon, especially of mass voter mobilisation, owes something to his predecessor in the Senate. And the power of Dirksen was the power of voice: in his case, a deep, vibrating baritone that could, as he wanted, be as smooth as bourbon or as rough as a Chicago pothole in January. Rhetoric matters in the United States in ways hard to grasp in Britain, for all our vaunted relish of parliamentary debate. Churchill, our paragon of the inspirational voice, claimed he had learned the art of holding ""thousands in thrall"" from the County Sligo-born New York politician Bourke Cockrane in the 1890s. Phrases from American speeches have entered and lodged in the common culture - and not just from Lincoln and FDR but from the likes of William Jennings Bryan, who thundered about the gold standard that ""they shall not crucify us on a cross of gold"". Even those with only a faintly passing interest in history will know ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"" or ""ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country"". But while Churchill passes the memory test, who in Britain can remember anything from the speeches of those pantheonised as our great orators: Charles James Fox, Gladstone, Lloyd George, Bevan? Even so, the great surprise of the past campaign was Obama's resurrection of the power of the word. The electricity it generated, multiplied and amplified by the web, was not in conflict with the hard ground game of putting feet on the streets; but the fuel of mobilisation. There was a telling moment in the television debates when Hillary Clinton tried to characterise Obama as a glib but ultimately empty wordsmith beside her record of concrete. She was knowingly tapping into an old, rich tradition of suspicion against fancy highfalutin speechifying and anything smelling of the intellectual that runs through American democratic populism. But Obama neatly turned the moment against her by insisting that words were, in fact, deeds; and that at many critical junctures in American life - from the revolution through the civil war to the great depression - they had turned the tide from despair to resolution. It was not surprising, then, that at Sunday's public concert at the Lincoln Memorial, performances by Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger and Mary J Blige were interspersed with the words of Jefferson, Lincoln, JFK and Dr King. Obama's oratory resonates beyond the cultural classes in ways that, for example, Adlai Stevenson never managed, because it draws on so many taproots of public diction in the US. It is not clear how much his speechwriter Jon Favreau contributes to the text, but there is no doubt that it is the speaker himself who is responsible for its main lines of thought and its finished version. Obama can turn on the American Cicero as could Jefferson - and generations of high-school and college students who had to read manuals on public rhetoric written by the Scottish divine Hugh Blair. But he can also, without artifice, sound the great bell of black preaching-teaching that goes all the way back to Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists. When he wants, he can do unite-the-nation stentorian and, when it seems right, do street cool and a kind of honky-friendly hip-hop that goes down a treat. But none of this would work if he did not do that simplest thing: tell the truth. That was the essence of his greatest speech on the campaign at Philadelphia on 18 March, when facing a firestorm over the unhinged denunciations of his pastor Jeremiah Wright. He could have wriggled out of it, let it cool down, done something judicious. But he didn't. Instead, he grasped the burning stick and let things happen as they did. It added courageous decency to mere cleverness and it spoke of qualities that augur well for a leader in rough times."
48,2009-01-20T19:30:01Z,Opinion,Tears and jeers in Tbilisi,"Even in Georgia's capital, there were few people mourning the end of George Bush's presidency","High on a hillside above the Georgian capital, the lounge of the Hotel Betsy was hopping with a thrilled crowd of American expats. George Bush's favourite ex-Soviet capital with its exaggerated and now, as it seems, foolish hopes of joining Nato ought to have been a last redoubt of Rebublican loyalty as America played out its dignified transition. But here too, in the presence of the local head of USAid, numerous diplomats and non-governmental organisations' staff, the place was awash with tears of excitement as the inauguration unfolded on a large plasma screen. Cheers greeted the sight of Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn as they appeared on the west front of the Capital. The same for Bill and Hillary Clinton. Boos were launched at Dick Cheney as his wheelchair hove into view. ""Push him off the end of the pier"", shouted one voice. There were boos too for George Bush as he made his way down the steps of the Capitol on his own, ""abandoned by everyone including his wife"", said another voice. Silence fell during the swearing-in and the inaugural speech but gave way to cheers and toasts as America's new president finished his riveting address. Then the crowd rose as one to sing the Star-Spangled Banner. ""I hope I never see that fucker again"", said a woman who had worked in the Clinton administration as she watched Bush clamber into his helicopter. When the ex-President turned to wave, the crowd of several dozen Americans rose again and waved with a good deal more fervour than the departing Chief Executive. A US employee of the International Republican Institute, which conducts a ""democracy promotion"" programme in Georgia, was as delighted as any Democrat. Confessing to have voted for John McCain in spite of his being an ""asshole"", the official was thrilled to see Bush's departing back. It was a strong lesson for Georgians that patriotism can trump party loyalty. The room pulsated with pride at the way their country could conduct a peaceful and orderly transfer of power with such serenity, unlike Georgia's recent record of falsified elections and street demonstrations. For these Americans who have chosen to make their lives abroad, at least for a time, there was also a sense that they can hold their heads high again in the world beyond their shores. Beaming with delight, one man quoted the words Gerald Ford uttered after he took the oath after Nixon resigned in 1974: ""Our long national nightmare is over"". Or, as another put it graphically when he approached a stranger and discovered he was British, ""I think we are back. I apologise for the last eight years""."
49,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Obama's historic inauguration lifts the fog over America,NA,"After eight years of arguably one of the world's most unpopular presidencies, I am relieved that George Bush's time in office has finally come to an end (Leaders, 17 January). He leaves behind a detestable legacy. His kneejerk reaction to the September 11 atrocity in 2001 has ensured that the world has become a more unstable and volatile place. His administration with its ""war on terror"" has caused thousands of innocent deaths in Afghanistan and continues to drown Iraq in a sea of innocent blood. As a consequence the Taliban has remerged more powerful and Iraq has been exposed to civil war. He has supported the torture of alleged Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. Domestically he leaves behind 40 million Americans without access to healthcare and an economy on the brink of collapse. In my opinion it was very fortunate only a pair of shoes was thrown at him. Seán Ó Floinn Weybridge, Surrey Bob Dylan's Masters of War raised my awareness in 1963. Now, it provides a suitable tribute to outgoing President Bush. ""You fasten the triggers/ For the others to fire/ Then you sit back and watch/ As the death count gets higher./ You hide in your mansion/ As young people's blood/ Flows out of their bodies/ And is buried in the mud"". Your ""Good riddance"" is too kind to him.

51,2009-01-20T18:04:52Z,Opinion,"Hello, Mr President",Barack Obama's inauguration offered moving oratory from our new president – and pompous blathering from everyone else,"When I first tune in to watch the morning's festivities, I am at least as excited, if not more so, that this is George Bush's last day as president as I am that it is Barack Obama's first. It is, however, mere moments before footage of the crowd – that amazing, breathtaking crowd – makes me giddy with anticipation and disinclined to look backward, no matter how thrilled to see the back of Bush I am. And oh how thrilled I am. But before I can toast my new president, I've got hours of the usual cable shenanigans through which to sit. MSNBC is the usual mix of absurdity and unexamined privilege, as Chris Matthews compares the Bushes to the Romanovs (starring Miss Beazley as Anastasia!) and Keith Olbermann says they're so far away that Obama will ""look like a raisin"". CNN is predictably boring with their ""facts"" and ""restraint"", so I head back to MSNBC, where Matthews waxes global, informing me that the US is not as monarchical as outsiders think. Why, just recently US supreme court chief justice John Roberts's wife was standing next to him at the cobbler's! I switch to Fox News. It's just a test pattern accompanied by audio of Sean Hannity quietly sobbing. Back to MSNBC, where Matthews is now rhapsodising about the concept of democracy, telling me there is a sense in America that, ""on some level"", all people are equal. This note is followed immediately by images of Dan Quayle entering the inauguration with Al Gore right behind him, and I think: Yes, Matthews is right. You can be a rich, white, idiot dude or a rich, white, genius dude and become vice-president. Go equality! Maude bless the USA. When Bush appears moments later, he is booed. Highly inappropriate, wildly disrespectful and, of course, totally hilarious. Dick Cheney is wheeled in, owing to a pulled muscle from moving boxes, presumably to a giant shredding truck parked in front of his residence. On nearly all the news coverage, there is some comment about how almost anticlimactic, or, perhaps more accurately, anachronistic this inaugural seems. Between Bush having checked out of the job about two years ago, the election having lasted two years and Obama having given a third as many press conferences since being elected as Bush gave in eight years, the introduction of Obama as president seems somehow incongruous to those paying intimate attention. Still, it's clearly inauguration day, as evidenced by the fearsome spinning in the graves of Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms, George Wallace, Orval Faubus, Fielding Wright and other famous elder statesmen-racists. Back at the inaugural, Pastor Rick Warren delivers an overtly Christian invocation to the collective chagrin of progressives, including every progressive Christian I know. He refers to the proceedings as ""the peaceful transfer of power for the 44th time"". Sure it is. Inherent math problem aside, tell that to Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, buddy. When Obama arrives, he is the picture of cool calm collectedness, and only looks nervous for the first time during the oath. And then it is done – and we have a new president. Barack Hussein Obama gives his first speech as our president, and its every word and every beautiful turn of phrase appeals to our better natures. It implores us to service, to sacrifice, to shared responsibility. It asks for our imagination and our participation. It says, in each idea, each exhortation, each question, each sentence: I am a uniter, not a divider. And on this day, listening to a man who is American and African, black and white, privileged and subjugated, sceptical and hopeful, abandoned son and present father, fresh-faced and graying at his temples, I give myself a moment to believe the possibility that he really is. The Rev Joseph Lowery gives the benediction, during which he asks that we all ""make choices on the side of love not hate, on the side of inclusion not exclusion, tolerance not intolerance,"" as if to underline the point – and simultaneously remind us all that our new president has occasionally fallen far short of that mark himself. Former President Bush flies away for the last time in Marine One, to a chorus of voices singing ""Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye"". Keith Olbermann pompously quotes Shakespeare. Chris Matthews says something tragic about Kennedy's fedora. And suddenly it's just another day in Washington again."
52,2009-01-20T13:00:01Z,Opinion,Towards the enlightened middle,"To quell the simmering discontent between the US and Muslims, Obama must embrace diplomacy and foster respectful dialogue","On inauguration day, Muslims and citizens worldwide will optimistically and anxiously begin purging the sordid memory of the disastrous and obtuse arrogance of the Bush administration. Even Barack Obama cannot completely cleanse the collective stain of the Bush era that squandered global goodwill with two failed wars, a belligerent rhetoric of a clash of civilisations, unyielding support for Israel's occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and the shameful, morally indefensible legacies of Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. To quell the simmering discontent and unrest between the United States and Muslims, Barack Obama – the appointed Superman of the 21st century's globalised, multicultural world – can flex his powers and demonstrate heroism by embracing diplomacy, renouncing hypocritical and selfish policy initiatives and spearheading a dialogue fuelled by respect and mutual understanding. ""A president can set a tone for a nation. President Bush used fear to further his policies. President Obama will hopefully set a tone of tolerance and inclusiveness,"" suggests Dean Obeidallah, an award-winning Arab-American comedian who has travelled across the Middle East, echoing the sentiments of many Muslims and Arabs worldwide. However, buyer's remorse seems to have set in for many Muslims following the usually verbose and eloquent Obama's unusual silence concerning Israel's relentless bombardment of Gaza that has killed over 900 Palestinians and wounded nearly 4,000 more. Obama's reluctance to vocally condemn Israel's punishing militarism against Palestinians has forced many Muslims to believe he will be a Manchurian candidate instead of a superhero; a mere parrot who recycles the ineffective ""support Israel above all else"" narrative to the detriment of brokering a tangible peace process that includes the Palestinians as viable partners. As Jamal El-shayyal, a Middle East expert and producer for Aljazeera, told me: ""The Egyptian public like the rest of the Arab world is not too optimistic for a change in policy during the Obama administration … the majority of people do not regard US foreign policy with the slightest respect. Many view it as biased, oppressive and at times even inhumane."" Dealing fairly with the citizens of Palestine serves as the ideal template for Obama to prove that his eloquent rhetoric of change was not just a politically savvy, Machiavellian ruse. Currently, however, the US is predictably staying on its antiquated course by emerging as the only UN security council member who abstained from voting on a resolution expressing ""grave concern"" about the growing humanitarian crisis and heavy civilian casualties in Gaza. At Aipac's annual conference last summer, Obama followed suit by promising he would ""never compromise when it comes to Israel's security"". Meanwhile, incoming secretary of state Clinton affirmed ""the United States stands with Israel now and forever"". Obama's new government can continue to ignore the concerns of Palestinians and instead unconditionally defend Israel to ensure purely selfish US and Israeli policy initiatives, but at what cost? Dr Hatem Bazian, an adjunct professor at the Boalt School of Law and lecturer at the University of California Berkeley, predicted the logical, dire consequence of such a myopic policy: ""If the US under Obama does not move swiftly to change course and address the need for a real peace in Palestine for representative democratic political process in corrupt and autocratic regimes then the next conflicts will be more bloody and far more destructive than what we are witnessing today."" Hosni Mubarak's repressive and stifling dictatorship in Egypt, which is strongly supported by the United States but reviled by Egyptians, is increasingly threatened by the emergence of hard-line, Islamic governments such as Hamas. Its success emboldens Mubarak's rivals, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, a popular Muslim political and social organisation and major opposition to Mubarak's rule. As a close US ally, Mubarak closed Egypt's borders to fleeing Gaza refugees and offered a harsh rebuke to Hamas for firing Qassam rockets despite criticisms of such rhetoric by angry Egyptians. If Obama indeed practices the diplomacy he preaches and wants to eschew America's mantle of selfish hypocrisy, he must at the very least interact with democratically elected Muslim governments and representatives, like Hamas and Ahmadinejad of Iran, especially considering the US has no problem aligning itself closely with the oppressive regime in Mubarak's Egypt and Saudi Arabia. However, it bears noting that not all Islamic oriented governments are radical or hard-line reactionaries, as seen in Turkey and Indonesia. Thus a wholesale demonisation and rejection of Islamic based governments and political groups is an affront to the Muslims who elected them, a perpetuation of Bush's ""clash of civilisation"" rhetoric seeped in religious and racial intolerance, and ultimately a diplomatic hindrance that sours and corrupts a relationship that could have flourished as a beneficial alliance in the war on terror. Also, it must be noted that the Muslim world, both in America and abroad, is not a monolithic Borg entity that can be easily demarcated between enraged fundamentalists and secular modernists. Furthermore, many Muslims, just like Americans, appreciate the complexities and nuances of global politics and foreign diplomacy. Willow Wilson, a Muslim essayist and comic book author who has lived in Egypt, agrees: ""To me, the 'clash of civilisations' never seemed as dire in the Muslim world as it is here [in America]. With the exception of extremists, people in the Muslim Middle East seem quite willing to separate Americans from their government."" Ultimately, the perceived hypocrisy of US foreign policy with the Muslim world – in stark contrast to its espoused democratic ideals and values – must be radically altered by Obama's rhetoric and initiatives. As Dalia Mogahed, the director of the Gallup Centre for Muslim Studies and co-author of the indispensable Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think, told me after years of polling Muslims worldwide: ""Muslims admire what we call 'western values' of equality and human rights, but do not believe that we as [Americans] live these values in our treatment of them. … To regain trust, America must project an image, through its actions, consistent with its promise to the world."" From this perspective, the Muslim world has been intently watching how Obama – and by extension America – treats its very own Muslim-American citizens. Despite record voter turnout and a highly organised, proactive civic engagement during the election, many Muslim-Americans feel spurned by Obama as if they were political kryptonite or modern day Boo Radleys. This is also evidenced by a national hysteria whose fear of Muslims forced AirTran to remove innocent Muslim-American patrons from their airplane. Despite the FBI giving security clearance to the Muslim-American family and vouching for their normalcy, they were removed to placate the misplaced paranoia of a few passengers. To make matters worse, Obama, unlike George Bush, refused to visit a mosque during his presidential campaign so the taint of Muslim would not dare rub off on him. (At the time, 13% of Americans were convinced Obama was an undercover Muslim and thus perceived him negatively.) His staff also ignominiously removed two visible hijabi (veiled) Muslim women from the stands so they would not appear on camera. Even the architect of two major Iraq wars, Colin Powell, strenuously denounced the rampant fear mongering and unwarranted questioning of Muslim Americans and their alleged loyalty and patriotism to the United States. However, Obama – or any ranking Democrat for that matter – has yet to publicly denounce such divisionary and bigoted rhetoric. Obama could have – and should have – mentioned Arabs and Muslims in his victory speech especially considering he stressed inclusiveness and respect for diversity among straights and gays, blacks and whites, abled and disabled. Would a mention of Muslims, Arabs and Jews not help tremendously in bridging the divides? However, Obama can redeem this oversight through his historic inauguration speech. Such inviting rhetoric shows Muslims at home and abroad that Obama's generation seek dialogue in which both parties reach across the table to shake hands and finally talk to one another instead of at one another. As Ms Mogahed told me: ""More than anything, Muslims want to be respected as equal human beings; neither parented or demonised by the west. Obama must make Muslims feel that they are partners, not subjects or suspects, in the challenges facing our world."" The clash of civilisations might be paved with extremism, intolerance and reckless aggression, but the road to moderation is a two way dialogue traversed with sincerity, mutual respect and desire for change through understanding. Let's hope Obama and Muslims both begin their walk and meet each other somewhere in the enlightened middle."
53,2009-01-20T18:57:26Z,News,'Yes we did!' Witnesses to history delighted as new era begins,"At Washington's National Mall, Obama supporters welcome their new president – but have only boos for George Bush","The sound of the first cannon shot heralding the beginning of the Barack Obama era was still travelling over the human sea that had poured into the Mall when the call went out from a man in a woolly red hat. ""We have a real president,"" he cheered. Then out of habit or reflex, the people around him began to chant the Obama anthem of these last two years: ""Yes we can, yes we can,"" until someone remembered the candidate was now the president. ""Yes, we did,"" someone yelled, and there was a hush as those around him took it in: Obama, once the unlikeliest of candidates, was now the president. ""Yes, we did,"" said a woman in an ankle-length fur with tears in her eyes. ""Amen."" For the multitudes who occupied the grounds west of the Capitol to the Washington Monument, today was an occasion of solemnity as well as celebration. People shared snacks and hand warmers, and offered extravagant apologies for grazing other bodies. Any jostling for a better sight line to Obama – a tiny dark figure on a building of blinding whiteness under the winter sun from this vantage point – was looked on with disapproval. ""That's not in the keeping of the spirit of the day,"" chided one woman. But there were also some hungering for retribution. When the arrival of Laura Bush was announced, there was a delay before a dutiful smattering of applause from the VIP seats. When her husband turned up, there was a cascade of boos. ""Impeach him,"" someone yelled as the orchestra began Hail to the Chief. From above the Mall came a reprise of the songs that protesters had sung outside the White House on election night: ""Sha na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye."" ""Oh stop,"" said Elizabeth Stoehr, a sculptor from Cincinnati who had been a campaign volunteer during the election. ""We're close enough to the end,"" she said. ""He's moving on. Let him finish it in peace."" Behind her, a woman booed again, and yelled: ""I love it."" The reaction to George Bush notwithstanding, this was a crowd with enormous reservoirs of goodwill, as well as fortitude. It was for many thousands an act of immense determination just to get to the Mall. By 6am, still before sunrise, the parking lots at the outermost ends of the Metro line were full, and the first spectators had made their way past the checkpoints and crowd-control barriers onto the Mall. Above ground, the city streets were taken over by a steady flood of people all bound for the Mall. Below, in the Metro lines running to the Mall, packed trains inched along towards the Capitol, their progress halted by the build-up of earlier trains. By 8am the nearest Metro stations to the Capitol had shut down, or given up collecting fares. But it still took 30 minutes for passengers to make their way from train platforms through the tunnels and climb up to daylight. As they waited underground in the dimly lit station, the chants went out again: ""O-bam-a"" and ""Yes, we can"". There were more queues – and more confusion – to come as the multitudes trudged towards the entry points to the Mall. ""This is like giving birth, squeezing everyone through a little hole, and we are the baby,"" grumbled Willie Blount, who works on IT in Congress. But despite their determination, and a good-natured tone, many turned back before they even reached the checkpoints, defeated by the long lines and the cold. A few, who had squeezed with the crowds through the narrow entrance to be disgorged on the lawns west of the Capitol, wondered whether it had been worth it. ""I'm going to have to go home on watch this on YouTube,"" said a 14-year-old girl from Connecticut who had got up at 5am to see Obama being sworn in. But they were the few. For the many on the Mall, the crowds, the extreme weather, and the security all soon receded against the momentousness of the occasion. Katie B Catalon, the president of the National Beauty Culturalists League, said: ""For me to see this promise fulfilled, not just of Martin Luther King, but of all our forbears in the civil rights movement, to me, this is the epitome of hope."""
54,2009-01-20T17:08:15Z,News,Labour MP blames Tories for disrupting broadcast of Barack Obama's speech,NA,"MPs who were hoping to watch the whole of Barack Obama's inauguration speech live were interrupted when the division bell went off just after the new president started speaking. There was a vote on some EU documents relating to the Brussels economic recovery plan. The ever-creative Denis MacShane, the Labour former foreign minister, has just put out a press release claiming that this amounts to a Tory snub to the new leader of the free world. I was saddened to leave Mr Obama's world historic speech in order to feed Conservative isolationism by voting in a division on a vote to take note of European Union policy on the financial crisis. There was no decision impacting on UK law or government decisions but the Tories are so obsessed against Europe they called a division just after Mr Obama had begin his speech. I hope our friends in America take note that David Cameron would rather have UK legislators voting symbolically against Europe rather than listening to President Obama's historic speech."
55,2009-01-20T18:45:11Z,News,Jubilation and resignation as world reacts to arrival of new US president,Citizens from Africa to the Middle East explain how they think Barack Obama's presidency will affect the planet's hotspots,"Saeed Kamali Dehghan in Tehran Barack Obama took office amid fevered speculation that the moderate former president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami, was to announce his candidacy for Iran's upcoming presidential elections. Khatami told aides that he would announce his decision in the next few days, local Iranian news agencies reported. With the prospect of a renewed Khatami presidency, thousands of Iranians who were watching the inauguration ceremony via their illegal satellite dishes were given a glimmer of hope that three decades of Iran-US hostility might be about to end. Hamed Mohaghegh, 21, an industrial civil engineering student in Tehran, watching the ceremony on the BBC, said that the US had given its democracy a boost by electing an black man as president. ""Before Obama was elected, we had this impression in our country that a black man will never succeed to become the president of the States, a candidate who had an Arabic middle name, Hussein."" ""[Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad [the Iranian president] has also doubted, saying that he thinks that [American voters would] not let a black man become the president of the US,"" said Reza Ahmadi, 40, an Iranian maths teacher at a high school. Yet, others were disappointed that Obama had not responded to the letter of congratulation sent to him by Ahmadinejad. ""It seems that the whole world has a share of Obama's 'change that can happen' except Iranian people"", he added. Ali Mohammadi, 37, an Iranian businessman, thinks that bringing Obama on to the US political stage was the only choice Americans had. ""America is not popular and powerful as before; the US is rather notorious for its background in Iraq and Afghanistan right now and is facing an economic crisis, so Obama was the only one to stabilise the States not only economically but also to get back the US ex-reputation in the world,"" he said. Media Kashigar, 52, a well-known Iranian intellectual and critic, believes that US foreign policy toward Iran has not changed in at least the past 30 years. ""Iran-US conflict is not a governmental or administrational problem. It is a mutual state problem, so I think neither Obama nor anyone else in Iran can ease the debate easily in [the near] future,"" he said. ""I don't think the US president has much influence to change American foreign policy. We've experienced JF Kennedy, we've seen Clinton and Bush, but has there been any foreign policy apparent change in [the] past 60 years in the US?"" said Amirmehdi Rezaee, 60, an Iranian retired-employee of the country's government. Xan Rice in Kisumu ""I'm tingling like I'm in a sauna,"" said Samson Wakoli, a 26-year-old bank worker, as he watched Obama's speech with thousands of other Kenyans tonight on a giant screen near the shores of Lake Victoria. ""This gives me strength. We have waited so long. God is good, God is good, God is good."" As Bob Marley's One Love began to play, Ruth Odaga said she had been ""touched in a very special way"". ""Last January we were fighting here"" – the town of Kisumu was badly hit in Kenya's post-election violence – ""and now look at the happiness Obama has given everyone,"" she said. Celebrations were already in full swing across the country that includes ""the small village where my father was born"" that Obama referred to in his speech. In nearby Kogelo, where Obama Sr grew up, the party was at Barack Obama primary school, where classrooms had become makeshift hotels with names like Something Cold and Connie of Siaya. ""We are so proud of Barack,"" said Consolata ""Connie"" Oguna, a 55-year-old teacher. ""He is our son."" Male dancers wearing short pink-and-blue sisal skirts, feathers strapped to their arms and the occasional cloak made from the silky black and white fur of a colobus monkey, entertained the crowd. Hawkers sold T-shirts, calendars and traditional print wraps. A photographer was selling framed portraits of his own holy trinity: Obama, Jesus Christ and the Kenyan prime minister, Raila Odinga, who is from this region. George Otieno, 19 and in his final year of study at the adjacent secondary school, said: ""By becoming US president, Obama has given us all hope. If you believe something then you can do it."" Back at the sports ground in Kisumu, a young boy, perhaps eight years old, danced along to the music, telling anyone who would listen: ""I'm the next Barack Obama, OK?"" Luke Harding in Moscow Obama's inauguration provoked a lukewarm response in Russia, with state television covering the event patchily, and the only public displays of attention breaking out in overtly expatriate venues. ""I don't think the relationship between our countries will change greatly,"" Igor Krasavin, 28, a philosophy lecturer from Yekaterinburg, predicted after the speech. He added, however: ""Personally, I like him."" Most Russians appear to agree – praising his ""powerful"" delivery but also noting he looked a bit nervous, especially at the beginning. They were generally optimistic that Obama would now bring positive changes, though. ""I expect him to practise a greener kind of politics,"" Konstantin Zgurovsky, a 56-year-old ecologist, said. ""I think he will pay greater attention to domestic problems and pull the US army out of Iraq."" Others were more equivocal. ""Unquestionably there will be changes. But what they are we still don't know yet. I hope he quickly resolves the US's crisis, so that Russia's economic problems become easier,"" Tatyana Bazlova, 27, from Pskov said. There was also general agreement that the 44th president could only be an improvement on the disastrous 43rd; George Bush is seen in Russia, as elsewhere, as a warmonger. Obama's speech was seen by many as a direct repudiation of the Bush legacy. ""I hope that Obama means that Russia and the US develop a pragmatic partnership. I hope Obama prefers to use his intelligence rather than war as a means of influence,"" Alena Pravidla, 31, from Moscow said. Martin Chulov in Baghdad Many Iraqis seemed nonplussed at the swearing-in of Obama, with some not knowing the inauguration was taking place and others consumed by the fall-out from the outgoing presidency. Obama's messages of change and remaking America have yet to resonate in the country that will help shape the legacy of his first years in office. Some Baghdadis, however, were impressed by his inauguration speech. ""If he can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over,"" said Abu Ali, the owner of a sparkling new restaurant, Shisha Cafe, in the city's Karada district. ""I believe he is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests,"" he added. ""That's it."" Another cafe-goer, Haitham Sarkis, said that his family had long ago stopped listening to Bush and become dispirited by his last three years in office. ""He kept telling us one thing, yet we were living the other,"" he said. ""This man never knew us and we are left with a massive mess that we must now pick up, not the new president."" The US presence on the streets of Baghdad may be slowly diminishing, but the withdrawal of the occupying forces is not generating a rise in America's popularity. Iraqi children and youths regularly taunt each other by removing their shoes and threatening to throw them – mimicking the local journalist who humiliated Bush during his last visit in December. ""Obama won't get the same treatment,"" said a nurse from the northern suburb of Adamiyeh, Um Nassir. ""But he won't have too long to prove himself to us."" Bush, however, is not a villain to all. ""He always said history will judge him,"" said Samira Musawi, a parliamentarian. ""But God will judge him as well and God has used Bush to remove the evil of Saddam and set the Iraqi nation free. It is now our responsibility to find the right way to direct this change."" Rory Carroll in Caracas Obama spoke of a world remade but Luis Fernando's Caracas slum did not look any different and he saw little reason to think US policy towards Hugo Chávez and Latin America would be any different. The 50-year-old security guard watched the inauguration speech dubbed into Spanish on a flickery TV and shrugged. ""Seems to me he is going to be just like the other one, Bush. He hasn't even started yet and he's already making threats against us."" Fernando, from El Valle, a hillside of precarious shacks in Venezuela's capital, supports Chávez's socialist revolution and is suspicious of the superpower. ""It's good that a man of colour is in the White House; he may show solidarity with Latin America."" But the self-proclaimed ""Chavista"" echoed his beloved president in suspecting that as surely as a tropical sun shone overhead Washington would stir trouble. Chávez reaped acclaim for standing up to Bush, who backed a failed coup against him in 2002 before going on to invade Iraq. The oil-rich leader cast his revolution as a beacon in the fight against imperialism and claimed Venezuela was next in the Pentagon's sights. The rhetoric galvanised his red-clad supporters and tarred opponents as CIA stooges. The ascent of a black US president who opposed the Iraq war has presented Chávez, who revels in confrontation, with a dilemma. He initially celebrated Obama's election but recently said Obama shared Bush's ""stench"" and was trying to destabilise Venezuela. State media echoed that today with warnings that Obama would be hostage to US corporate and military interests. ""We don't have many illusions; he has already started baring his teeth against Venezuela,"" said the newspaper Diario Vea. Fernando gazed at the TV images of cannons firing in salute and sighed. ""Let's give Obama a chance. Give him some time and see what he does."" Rory McCarthy in Gaza City In the Popeye Cafe in Gaza City, dozens of young Palestinians sat in front of the television drinking tea and smoking water-pipes tonight, but, though they glanced up at Obama's speech occasionally, very few believe the new US president will make any difference to their lives. ""I have a feeling deep inside me that we shouldn't expect anything from Obama,"" said Taher Yazji, 24, whose family runs a printing business. ""All of them speak of the Middle East as a priority but we don't see anything from them, no results at all. I don't think the ordinary people of America understand what has happened to us. I don't think that anyone looks at the Palestinians. We're just trying to defend our homeland in the same way they defend their homeland."" Ask a Gazan what they would like to see from a US president, what would change their lives for the better, and they all give the same answer: lift the long and painful economic blockade that Israel has imposed on this small, overcrowded territory of 1.5 million people. That blockade remains in place even after three weeks of war which claimed 1,360 Palestinian and 13 Israeli lives. Masood Samouni, 22, sat upstairs at the cafe. Two weeks ago he lost his sister, two aunts and many more relatives when the Israeli forces shelled their homes in Zeitoun, on the southern outskirts of Gaza. ""I just came out to try and forget some of the bad memories,"" he said. He was dressed in his friend's clothes and hasn't yet had the courage to go home. ""I know the American people are optimistic about Obama and I do believe that some of them understand our situation and show solidarity with us. But we're being squeezed here. We just want to feel safe and secure. I hope the new president will make a change and put pressure on Israel and Egypt to let them open the crossings and let us go abroad and live our lives."" His friend, Salah Khalifa, 22, a student of business administration, said: ""We hope he'll make a change. I'm optimistic because we need a solution for the Palestinian issue."" Ahmed Yazji, 29, one of the waiters, stopped to watch the speech translated into Arabic on the al-Arabiya television channel but said he expected nothing new. ""We are here defending our rights and no one understands,"" he said. ""And if anyone says they really understand then they risk being killed – look what happened to Rabin."" Yitzhak Rabin, the former Israeli prime minister, was assassinated by a Jewish rightwing extremist in 1995 after signing the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians. ""This conflict will last until the end of time,"" said Yazji."
56,2009-01-20T15:00:00Z,Opinion,Frederick Douglass paved Obama's way,The US and UK have a special relationship. Barack Obama should remember Britain's role in transforming one of his heroes,"With the US's inauguration of its first African-American president today, you couldn't blame British officials for fretting about future relations between our two countries. As revealed last month, British colonial forces tortured Barack Obama's grandfather – a veteran of the second world war – during the fight for Kenyan independence and also arrested his father, Barack Obama Sr. Not surprisingly, then, Obama Jr has little good to say about Britain in his memoir, Dreams From My Father. In fact, aside from the founding fathers, it's hard to think of a US president with better reasons for holding a personal grudge against America's mother country. In hard times though, America and Britain tend to look to each other as old allies, and Gordon Brown (or his Tory pretender) could remind the new president just how special our relationship is by focusing on an oft-forgotten event from our shared past: Britain's role in not just freeing – but also transforming – one of Obama's heroes into a world champion of human rights. Though little known in the UK nowadays, Frederick Douglass is still famous in the US for his compelling life story. As a runaway slave, he turned himself into arguably the most eloquent opponent of slavery in the run-up to the civil war, an enduring role model whose words have resounded through the speeches of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and the new US president himself. Obama's former students at the University of Chicago remember him citing Douglass's ability to express high-minded ideals in down-to-earth language, while encompassing the views of both black and white Americans. ""No one speaks this way anymore,"" he told them. But few Americans realise that it was actually Britain that made Douglass. Indeed, he admired the British (especially the Scots) so much that he changed his surname from Bailey to Douglass in honour of a regal fugitive in the work of Sir Walter Scott. And he would have been immensely gratified to see America's first black president sworn in the same week as the 250th anniversary of his beloved ploughman poet, Robert Burns. Barely three years after escaping to the north, Douglass began denouncing the firsthand horrors of slavery under his assumed name – but he was so well spoken that his enemies accused him of being a fake. To silence them, he decided to disclose his owner's details in his Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, which (like Obama's memoir) became a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic. Having blown his own cover, though, Douglass was no longer safe. His owner could legally have him captured anywhere in the United States. So Douglass's allies arranged for the 28-year-old to go on a lecture tour of Great Britain starting in August 1845. ""Thus I was led to seek a refuge in monarchical England from the dangers of republican slavery,"" he wrote, noting that his journey also marked a reversal of the old slave-trade route: whereas many Africans had been exported to the Americas via Britain, he was a runaway slave seeking freedom from US justice in the UK. The reason for coming here was simple: Britain had outlawed slavery 12 years earlier, and as the source of US civilisation, Douglass and his fellow abolitionists hoped that Britain could use its ""moral force"" over the American elite. ""You have an influence on America that no other nation can have,"" he declared at his reception speech in London. In just 19 months, Douglass got to know the British Isles better than many Americans before or since, delivering more than 300 speeches in virtually every major town and city in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. But he also came here to perfect his speechmaking skills. ""Although Americans are generally better speakers than Englishmen,"" one of his compatriots told him, ""you will find in England individual orators superior to the best of ours."" Douglass got to see Disraeli and Peel in action, and he particularly admired the Irish Emancipator, Daniel O'Connell: ""His eloquence came down upon the vast assembly like a summer thundershower upon a dusty road."" For his part, Douglass also made an impression on his hosts. Tall, muscular, and respectful to a fault, he proved particularly popular with female Nonconformists – not least because he was an early advocate of women's rights. It was a couple of Quaker sisters from Newcastle who insisted on raising the funds to buy his freedom from his American master for £150 (roughly £10,000 today). ""Humane British men and women bought my body and bones with British gold, and made me a present to myself,"" Douglass said. ""I thank God that there is at least one Christian country on this globe where a coloured man may rest secure from the fury and vengeance of alarmed and terrified slaveholders."" Douglass's British supporters also offered to bring his wife and children over so they could live permanently in the UK. Instead, Douglass asked for funds to start his own African-American newspaper in the US – a move discouraged by his white American allies, who warned that previous attempts to found a black-owned paper had failed. Backed by his British sympathisers, though, Douglass's North Star would end up proving his American doubters wrong. Douglass finished his speaking tour of Britain in April 1847. ""I have here, for the first time in my life, known what it was to enjoy liberty,"" he said during his farewell speech in London. ""I go back to the United States not as I landed here – I came a slave; I go back a free man. I came here a thing – I go back a human being. I came here despised and maligned – I go back with reputation and celebrity."" ""Wherever I have gone, I have been treated with the utmost kindness, with the greatest deference, the most assiduous attention; and I have every reason to love England. … Wherever else I may be a stranger, in England I am at home."" Douglass was forced to seek refuge in Britain once more ahead of the civil war, having been falsely implicated in an attempt to start an armed slave revolt in October 1859. However, he soon returned to the states and went on to advise Abraham Lincoln during the war. He later became the first African-American to be nominated as vice-president, on a fringe-party ticket with America's first female presidential candidate in 1872. Douglass never did accept the nomination, though. He was too busy campaigning for Ulysses S Grant, who, like Lincoln (but unlike Obama) was actually a Republican. To quote Douglass's favourite verse by Burns, regardless of political colours, ""a man's a man for all that""."
57,2009-01-20T11:00:11Z,Opinion,A motto for the people,What does Obama have in common with first-century rabbis? An understanding of the power of words,"What do most people in this country – perhaps in the United States too – associate with Barack Obama ? It is not so much a detailed understanding of his policies, but a general feel about him offering promise and hope. It is summed up in the phrase that punctuated so many of his speeches: ""Yes we can"". Was it simply a campaign motto or was it something more? Positive and forward-looking, it goes beyond simple politics and has a religious resonance to it. It is not that political life cannot be positive and forward-looking, but that Obama seemed to be tapping into something beyond the immediate economic agenda and more connected with our long-term human potential. We want to believe that we can each make a difference; that we can have an effect on the world; that our lives are not in vain; that our existence is worthwhile; that the world can be a better place; that the current version of it does not have to be the final version; that in our own small way we count and have significance. There is a messianic quality about Obama's slogan that reminds me of various utterances by the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. It is close in its spirit of optimism to the political platform of Amos, who declared: ""Let justice run down like water and righteousness as an everlasting stream."" (5:24) Perhaps the most famous and influential biblical catchphrase belongs to Moses. His demand of Pharoah to ""Let my people go"" has reverberated down the centuries and across the world. It has been used by slaves in Mississippi, Baptists in the former Soviet Union and black people in Soweto. Incidentally, in Hebrew ""Let my people go"" is only three words (""shallach et ami"") – proof that, like Obama's three-word phrase, keeping it short can be effective and memorable. There are also two bon mots from rabbis of the first century, which embody a philosophy of positive action similar to the Obama manifesto. Hillel said ""If am not for myself, who is for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?"" It is a wonderfully succinct summary of the balance between protecting one's own rights and needs, yet also caring for those of others. But the punchline is the third sentence (""And if not now, when?""): it is not enough to theorise about it or make bold statements; what counts is going out and making it happen. Equally powerful is the motto of his younger colleague, Rabbi Tarfon, who said: ""It is not your duty to finish the work but neither are you free to neglect it"". It gives impetus to all those who see a massive task, be it eradicating typhoid or saving the environment, despair that they cannot solve it by themselves, but need to be part of the ongoing process that, over time and with the input of others, will eventually prove successful. The words of Hillel and Tarfon indicate the real greatness of Obama's phrase; it crossed over from being yet another clever soundbite into being a deep personal motto. Perhaps the best way to respond to ""Yes we can"" is not just to admire it, but to formulate a saying of our own that can help guide our personal lives and whose values we can bring into family and work situations. There is no reason why mottoes should only be for those who have a coat of arms to their name. Obama has reminded us of the power of inspiring words. It shows the influence he is having even before he has spent a day in office."
58,2009-01-20T20:35:42Z,Opinion,Obama's message to the Middle East,"In Jordan, Obama's inaugural message of hope to the Muslim world is overshadowed by the Gaza conflict","Watching Barack Obama's inauguration on television in Amman, Jordan, as he stumbled over his words during the oath, then spoke eloquently of Americans now choosing ""our better history"", I wanted to celebrate, like many, as we did in November. After the election, the change of mood in the normally subdued Jordanian capital was palpable. Everybody wanted to talk about Obama, and, with Tzipi Livni still a largely unknown figure here, there was genuine hope among many that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process would finally make the progress the Bush-Blair era made much noise about but never delivered. The sense of goodwill toward Obama also stemmed from optimism that, after eight disastrous years of Bush-Cheney foreign policy, Iraq might finally begin to heal and Guantanamo Bay might finally be closed. Troops out of Iraq means much to the estimated 500,000 Iraqis currently living in refugee camps in Jordan, many with little access to housing and education. Every conversation operated on the same three points: Obama, Iraq and hope. Today, however, the mood couldn't be more different, and the word that most often follows Obama's name in conversation is not ""Iraq"" but ""Gaza"". ""Hope"" is probably the last idea that would accompany it. The aerial bombardment and later ground invasion of the Gaza Strip over the last three weeks has changed everything, and few people here watched the build-up to the inauguration. While CNN is spending 48 hours in ceaseless coverage of events in Washington, reporting the great narrative of American political change, the focus of Arab news networks and of people in the Middle East is still largely on Gaza – the dead and the tens of thousands now homeless. Every Middle Easterner knows who Livni is now, and Obama is now often currently seen as the good man who did nothing – who, his difficult position during the transition period acknowledged, nonetheless frustrated many by barely speaking out while some 1,300 Gazans were killed by one of America's closest allies. Around half of Jordan's population is of recent Palestinian descent, and Gaza is less than 100 miles from Amman. But the geographic proximity felt increasingly like a bad joke or a mind trick, as the already-blockaded Strip became increasingly sealed under siege, and Jordanian-Palestinians were left unable to contact their families and friends on the other side of Israel. Obama encouraged Americans to spend this year's Martin Luther King day volunteering for their communities. Over the past three weeks here, Jordanians, Palestinians and others bought food and medical supplies and organised dozens of fundraisers for international charities working in Gaza. The Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation was overwhelmed by donations from ordinary people of canned food and medical supplies for UNRWA aid convoys, an initiative which suffered a setback on January 8 when UNRWA seemed about to leave Gaza when the its aid convoy was hit. Al Jazeera, the only television news network with a presence in Gaza during the military offensive, provided a constant (and eventually, perhaps, unhelpful) stream of graphic images of the dead and wounded civilians in Gaza. American networks seemed content to represent the feeling of the region solely through reporting Muslim Brotherhood-backed protests in the Middle East, replete with iconic stereotypes of flag-burning and violent threats – and there's no denying that the Gaza attack brought every odious, antisemitic Islamist spokesperson out of the woodwork. But many more ordinary Jordanians, Syrians and Lebanese participated in far-less-newsworthy efforts such as blood drives to help the injured in Gaza. With the tentative ceasefire now in place, Gaza, like many other tragedies, will go back to its low-level, un-newsworthy state of humanitarian crisis, and there will be little hope, or change, in this part of the world in the coming weeks. This is not to say Obama has become an unpopular figure here. If asked about him, most people still mention his speech facing the ruins of the Umayyad Palace in Amman last summer, and the fact that he has signalled a willingness, at least, to talk to all heads-of-state in order to repair international ties damaged by the Bush administration. But for the last three weeks here, you'd have to mention his name for people to talk about him. The great story of America's chance for change in Obama isn't the narrative that dominates the days here. Obama's inauguration is historic and contains, at least, the hope for change. Unlike most American stories pushing humanitarian tragedies off the front page, Obama deserves to dominate the world's news today. From here, the start of Obama's presidency is the start of one dream fulfilled. But the dream of a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians is still denied. It still festers. A hundred miles away from Gaza, it feels as though so much has happened since the optimism of November's election night that, while most here still wish Obama well, there is little to hope for or celebrate. In his inauguration speech, Obama claimed to ""seek a new way forward"" with the Muslim world, and that ""those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy"". Obama still represents a better chance than his predecessors for something lasting and just to be built in the Middle East, but it is far from being fulfilled."
59,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion,We will all remember where we were today - even in lazily cynical Britain,Monumental danger has summoned a man whose character matches the hour. Copying Obama must be a global habit,"There has never been a day like it for Britain's postwar generations. As that inauguration speech echoes out, the globe itself seems to inhale a mighty, collective intake of breath, frighteningly audacious in its hope. A BBC World Service poll shows a tidal wave of optimism about what Obama will do, spread out across a rainbow of nations. Here is the world's wish list: first save global finance from ruin; next get out of Iraq; then fix the climate and bring peace to the Middle East. Yes he can, is the world's expectation. How does the man's arrival feel here? A day like no other, in a time of multiple crisis like none other. In the years of plenty, the British since the war have known little political excitement. Novelists and playwrights scrabble about for drama: the miners' strike, the three-day week, Aldermaston and Greenham vie with the IMF's humiliating bailout or Margaret Thatcher's greed-is-good big bang years, alongside the day we crashed out of the ERM, or Labour's glory night in May 1997. But these are meagre political offerings through the years of fluctuating affluence. The IRA and now Islamist terror terrify - but they feel external, not integral to domestic politics, even if both are bloody paybacks from our past. The cold war came and went without the nuclear apocalypse we grew up expecting any day. When the Berlin wall came down, the great rejoicing was primarily a drama belonging to other people; it was not the end of history either. We fought a surprising number of small wars, hardly ruffling the phlegmatic British body politic: the Conservatives did not fall over the Suez debacle, and Blair was re-elected despite his Iraq disaster. We have not lived in the interesting times of the Chinese curse - but in banal times where politicians needed to be no better than they were. No great crisis summoned a Winston Churchill or a Franklin Delano Roosevelt. That uneventfulness has blunted our politics: people barely vote or express a view, while blase cynicism substitutes for thought, passion or partisanship. Parties clustered in the dead centre are dead on their feet, and no one cares much, except to sneer at politicians' expenses. The bitter truth of deep inequality has been disguised by an era of cheap imported goods and the anyone-can-make-it celebrity myth. An American model of each individual citizen for himself, each individual citizen the architect of his own life's trajectory, has conquered old notions of solidarity, not needed in good times. Look across Europe and little comfort can be drawn from any country's leadership, rendering its collective voice feebly uninspiring. In crisis, the EU risks pulling apart, not together, with rising nationalism and protectionism. Who do you call? The Czech Republic's current EU presidency? There has been little here to inspire political hope. But now Obama comes out of nowhere just when good politics has never mattered more. A complete collapse of the global financial system is not unimaginable. In uncharted waters, billions and trillions gush from governments everywhere, frantically shoring up banks that squandered trust. One thing looks grimly certain, however we get out of this: future deep debts threaten public services, long-lasting unemployment, real pay cuts and changed prospects in need of a new politics. The climate crisis is seen to be worsening with every new report, but worldwide action is still negligible and negligent: the Nasa scientist and leading climate expert Jim Hansen last week warned that only four years remain before an irreversible threshold is crossed, leading to raised sea levels that will drown many major cities. In Gaza, the horror of so many dead Palestinian children is a monstrous challenge to greet Obama. If ever the world needed saving, it's now. So here comes the man who says he can. It's an American mystery that this great pool of genius has usually thrown such minnows into the White House. But the monumental present danger has summoned forth a man who promises the intellect, character and power of persuasion to match the hour. On this day all alive will remember where they were when they saw Obama sworn in, when they heard him speak. I shall be in a Commons meeting room - where Dawn Butler, the black MP for Brent, will be launching ""Bernie's list"" to promote black candidates - with crowds of mainly ethnic-minority young Brent people gathered to watch Obama's speech. Since the rise of Obama, the MP says, throngs have come forward to join her campaign. I shall also see Chuka Umunna, the exceptional Labour candidate for Streatham, south London, address students in Brixton - students whom he finds are as eager as never before to think and do politics. ""Obama has changed everything. You can't overestimate the effect,"" he says. After time on the Obama campaign, Umunna says that the man's blackness is only one wonder: ""He has changed the possibilities of politics itself."" Winning while promising to tax the rich, cut tax for the poor, tackle the climate and reverse Bush's foreign policy, he has made the impossible possible. Let whoever will be cynical do so today: they will have their I-told-you-so moments. Political passion is unfashionable, risky, naive and destined for disappointment. Enthusiasm is rare in British politics, but today is a reminder that it is always worth celebrating the better over the worse. The hope is not just for what the man will do, but that his brand of politics rubs off on politicians everywhere. It wasn't until Obama was elected on a tax-the-rich ticket that Brown and Darling dared to follow suit, 11 years late. This is a day for politicians to take heart and dare to challenge recycled focus group prejudice. Copying Obama needs to become a global habit. In a revealing unpublished interview with the Obamas more than a decade ago, Michelle feared that he was ""too much the good guy for the kind of brutality and scepticism"" of politics. Ruthless calculation is indeed a necessary part of the art, but he seems to have that steely determination too. There is a limit to how moral any effective politician can be: ask that nice Jimmy Carter. Yet this is the day to honour the practice of politics as a high calling, where the power to inspire can swell the hearts of the world. Here at home, a respite from Britain's lazy political cynicism is in order. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"
60,2009-01-20T13:20:02Z,Opinion,The lessons of Obama.com,MPs should be learning from Obama's projects to include and inspire ordinary citizens – not voting to conceal their expenses,"He has talked about everything from saving banks to saving the planet. But, this weekend, and just before his inauguration on Tuesday, Barack Obama made his most exciting announcement yet. The doubters said he could never take his ""movement"" into government. He would, they said, have to leave behind the millions who knocked on doors and wrote $20 cheques. But, in a YouTube video to supporters, he found a way to open up government to include them through a new body, ""Organizing for America"", that will use the internet to help ""people like you who fought for change during the campaign to continue fighting for change in your communities"". It's a brave and potentially radical move. This will be the mothership for Obama 2.0. Now compare this to events here in the UK. How are our political leaders seizing on citizens' new appetite for involvement and information about politics? With a jaunty hop in the wrong direction, it seems, by planning to let all MPs keep their expenses a secret. Last week commons leader Harriet Harman found a good day to bury bad news, using the hullabaloo over Heathrow to slip out plans for a vote on the issue. If this passes on Thursday, MPs can keep their expenses secret forever. With government support, and Tory abstentions, it is very likely to pass into law within 24 hours. In my day job I help to run a non-partisan website called TheyWorkForYou.com, which allows normal people free and easy access to anything going on in parliament. From this I know that millions of my fellow citizens want, and need, basic factual information about our democracy. The assumptions in the minds of most MPs who have pushed for concealment of expenses is that the tabloids want this information only to embarrass them with stories about anything from loft extensions to expensive pot plants. And maybe they do. But my experience is that citizens think better of MPs once they know more about them. Equally, I have no problem with MPs claiming legitimate expenses. And I don't think most voters will either, if someone explains why they need to claim them. It might just be me, but it also seems a pretty terrible moment for MPs to be secretive about money. The country is battening down the hatches for the recession. People everywhere are watching the pennies. What sort of signal does it send to give the impression that MPs are supplementing their income through dodgy receipts? Certainly, Obama considers transparency to be a vote winner in the internet age. In April 2006, he and John McCain introduced a bill to the Senate to publish full details of all organisations receiving federal money – which became known as their ""Google for Government"" plan. In the campaign that followed both outdid each other to be more open. Even before the announcement of ""Organizing for America"" Obama's team had begun to walk the walk, posting documents from official meetings on their website and including a raft of pro-transparency measures in their policies. The same should be true here. Gordon Brown says he wants to ""modernise"" our democracy. David Cameron, meanwhile, says we live in a ""post-bureaucratic age"" in which, because of information, ""people are taking more control of their lives."" I agree. But, on this one, both are dropping the ball. In a system shrouded in secrecy, this vote is highly symbolic. Publishing MPs expenses would send the right signals. At the very least, MPs should vote to publish their future expenses in detail, creating positive incentives for prudence and a signal that the whole system is heading in the right direction. The overall direction of policy in what the government likes to call ""digital Britain"" openness should be to follow Obama, not grind into reverse gear. At the moment we're a long way behind the US. We don't have a ""Google for government"". We don't know which lobbyists meet our ministers. We don't see minutes of politician's meetings, or see their diaries. But, next week, if we decide to, we can and should be able to see MPs' expenses. It's about time MPs learned to fear the tabloids a little less, and show a little more faith in their fellow citizens. That's a change we could all believe in."
61,2009-01-20T12:00:01Z,Opinion,Post-inauguration depression,"Like John Kennedy and Tony Blair before him, Barack Obama may find it hard to live up to his inspiring rhetoric","As Barack Obama rides into Washington, joy unbounded is unleashed around the world. Once again, everyone from the centre to the left feels the tide of history turning our way. But for me, the echoes of similar welcomes for the arrivals into power of John Kennedy and Tony Blair are tinged with the memory of disappointment. This is not the same as simply expecting too much too soon of one man. Especially today, that is a legitimate concern in a complex world of interlocking factors beyond any one person's control. No, I'm referring to an almost wishful misreading of what Kennedy and Blair actually stood for. That they were intelligent, well educated and eloquent invoked a kind of uncritical idealising of the men themselves. When Kennedy started slipping women into the White House through the back door, it only added to his glamour. That he had intellectuals and poets to dinner fuelled the mythology of his Camelot. This was the same man who endorsed the misguided invasion of Cuba. He failed to sign legislation banning federal funding to firms who discriminated against black people. Lyndon Johnson – a southerner – signed it straight away. I recall Kennedy at my graduation from Harvard, on the top steps of Widener Library, legs apart, hands on hips with top hat tipped back and smoking a cigar. From behind he looked like just another pol, albeit an eloquent and intelligent one. Kennedy's death saved him from being outed. That was not the fate of Harold Wilson, who, like Kennedy won a narrow victory on the promise of change – harnessing ""the white heat of technology"". This was the man who let the jump jet among many inventions leave the country. The brain drain started on his watch as underpaid and undervalued scientists left for better jobs. Though he had the courage to challenge racism, the death penalty and homophobia, he is remembered for devious political manoeuvring and appointing his mistress and cronies to the Lords. When Blair won, my company took the day off to celebrate. I even became British to vote against the Tories. But his political self emerged in his first year. He exempted formula one motor racing from the ban on tobacco sponsorship after a donation from Bernie Ecclestone. He carried on his uncritical courtship of the city and private sector – signing letters for Mittal steel, promoting 24-hour drinking, super-casinos and other illiberal causes. He encouraged deregulation, PFI bonanzas that made the Thatcher years look austere. Not to mention the Iraq war. He dismissed the protest of millions before the day was over – ""so Iraqis would have the right to protest too"". Of course, Kennedy, Wilson and Blair did many good things. But the expectation they would live up to their own rhetoric belied the reality of political life, human weakness, vanity and the desire to be liked – as later revealed by their advisers. It is sad and unfair that they may be remembered more for our disappointment in them rather than their achievements. And that's the rub. We want politicians like Obama, Blair, Wilson and Kennedy to be our better selves – indeed better than our better selves. Reading Obama's wonderful autobiography, Dreams of My Father, I could not help but succumb to the hope that this man so painfully self-aware and self-critical might be different. He might just remember his time on the streets of Chicago and the needs of the poor people he tried to help. For him, grassroots are familiar territory, not just a phrase written for him by a smart speechwriter. But there I go, hoping again that Obama will be different. It's that old problem – pessimism of the head and optimism of the heart. But even after all the disillusionment with politics, it keeps me going."
62,2009-01-20T08:00:00Z,Opinion,"Marginalised, but angry",The religious right may be splintered and adrift but its most radical elements could become more dangerous than ever,"The question: Will Obama be good for religion? These are dark days for America's religious right. During the Bush administration, Christian conservatives formed the most powerful social movement in the United States. Now they're marginalised and dejected. Though they succeeded in overturning gay marriage in California, their victory there was a kind of last electoral hurrah. Focus on the Family, the Colorado-based theocon behemoth that's big enough to have its own zip code, pumped so much money into the effort that, in its aftermath, the group had to lay off nearly a fifth of its workforce. In 2004, preachers whipped vast crowds into ecstasies of outrage by railing against a homosexual menace said to be corrupting the nation with sexual sin and leaving it weakened and vulnerable to terrorism. But with tolerance increasing even as the wrecked economy gives voters more concrete things to worry about, anti-gay demagoguery is now paying diminishing returns. In one way, Obama's invitation to the fundamentalist preacher Rick Warren to give the opening prayer at his inauguration signalled that the religious right is still relevant. Yet Warren's behavior during the ensuing controversy shows that he realises where mainstream opinion is heading. Pastor of Southern California's Saddleback megachurch, Warren is a canny impresario who is desperate for popular attention and acclaim, and he clearly realised that the national conversation over his long-standing homophobia was harming his reputation. Thus, besides going on and on about all his gay friends, he scrubbed language from his church's website which had said that someone ""unwilling to repent of their homosexual lifestyle would not be accepted at [sic] a member at Saddleback."" It's telling that even a preacher who has worked to strip gay people of their rights, and who has compared gay sex to incest and peadophilia, fears being seen as intolerant. After all, an older generation of fame-loving clerics wore their homophobia like a badge of honour. Yet if the religious right is splintered and adrift, its most radical elements could become more dangerous than ever. During the election, some Republicans argued that, should Obama become president, we would see renewed terrorist attacks on the United States. They might have been right, though not in the sense they intended. The 1990s saw a deadly series of rightwing domestic terrorist assaults – the Oklahoma City bombing, the bombing of the 1996 Olympics, the murders of several gynaecologists who performed abortions, and many bombings, arson and acid attacks on women's health clinics. As the LA Times reported last year, such violence fell off precipitously during the Bush presidency, for a number of reasons. ""Many observers attribute [the decline] to Sept. 11, for diverting the rage of disaffected Americans away from the US government and toward foreigners, and for fueling the subsequent Patriot Act-driven crackdown,"" wrote the Times. ""Others say the movement began to crumble earlier, when the Y2K disaster, a favourite prediction of conspiracy theorists, failed to materialise."" A third factor, not considered by the paper, was that as the right saw its agenda progress legislatively, some of the frustrated rage that led extremists to defy the law was dissipated. Shut out once again, it's not unlikely that a few on the fringe will once again turn to violence. Indeed, the very economic angst that has rendered the religious right broadly irrelevant may help radicalise a tiny minority of alienated and humiliated people casting about for someone to blame. In the last few months, I've spoken to several people who work at health clinics that perform abortions, and they've told me they're beefing up their security to prepare for that possibility. For liberals, one of the terrifying things about the Bush years was watching people and ideas that had once occupied a weird reactionary underground suddenly move into the centre of American life. Now, those who believe that evolution is a sinister hoax, or that the second coming is imminent and should perhaps be helped along, or that gay people are a threat to the republic and a menace to children, or that legal abortion is a reprise of the Holocaust, will no longer be able to exercise much political power. The most zealous will find another way to be heard."
63,2009-01-20T18:29:01Z,Opinion,"America, under new management",Barack Obama sent out a double-edged message today: the US is ready to make a fresh start – but it will be no soft touch,"If Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, North Korea's King Jong-il, or Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe were watching Barack Obama's inauguration address, they might be forgiven for thinking that the following lines, delivered with cool, determined confidence, were directed straight at them: To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west – know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist. There, summed up in a couple of sentences, was the double-edged message that America's rookie president wanted to convey to those around the world who have suffered most, and raged, defied and taunted the most, during the confrontational Bush years. The US, under new management, was ready to lead again, was ready to make a fresh start, was prepared to learn from its mistakes, keen to revert, revive and re-base its policies on ageless values handed down from the Founding Fathers. At the same time, he made plain Obama's America would be no soft touch, no pushover for those who chose confrontation and violence instead of rapprochement and dialogue. We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger, and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you. Obama's message to the world was also a message to Americans who have watched, often appalled, as the Bush-Cheney axis subjugated the constitution and civil liberties, at home as well as abroad, to the supposedly paramount, unquestionable cause of an endless, elastic, global ""war on terror"" We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ... Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more. Obama went on to castigate his predecessor, without actually naming him, summoning as witness the achievements of previous generations. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint. Two pledges – to work to roll back the nuclear threat and counter the spectre of global warming – were particularly welcome after the prevarication and obfuscation of the Bush era. But there were also evident blind spots. It is difficult to see quite what Obama meant in pledging to ""forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan"". His policy, as presently understood, will certainly lead to a military escalation that many professional soldiers (and Afghans) fear will only make matters worse. Perhaps Obama's most resonant outreach beyond America's shores was to the lands and peoples of Islam, many of whom became convinced during the Bush presidency that the west had launched a new crusade against them. He addressed Muslims directly, this man whose middle name is Hussein and was not afraid to use it on the biggest day of his life. ""To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect,"" he said. When Obama said the world has changed and we must change with it, he was talking to everyone, not just US citizens. The word from the White House, at last, was inclusive. In the face of his example, he suggested the old barriers cannot stand – and the change of which he is the symbol belongs to all, if only they will embrace it. Muslim nations and others will wait to see how, if at all, Inauguration Day's fine, hope-inspiring words translate into action. But whatever happens next, it's good, after eight barren, murderous, divisive years, to once again have an American who knows how to lead."
64,2009-01-20T11:50:21Z,News,Inauguration briefing: Making history,NA,"A momentous milestone And so here we are at last. A little before noon today - the precise timing is mandated by the constitution - Barack Obama will become the 44th president of the United States, the culmination of a long electoral journey that began almost two years ago on a similarly freezing day in Springfield, Illinois, when the then 45-year-old declared his candidacy. But the swearing-in of America's first black president is a momentous milestone on a far greater national journey too, and the atmosphere on the streets of Washington is suitably thrilling. Visitors from across the country and the world are descending on the capital to share a unique moment in history. Suzanne Goldenberg joins them and soaks up the atmosphere in today's Guardian. Estimates for the size of the crowd expected today have stretched from one million to as high as five million, but this week the authorities gave up, admitting that nobody really knows how many people will arrive to watch - from much-sought-after ticketed seats or on giant TV screens - as Obama takes office and George Bush leaves the city by helicopter. The fervour contrasts starkly with the preternaturally calm demeanour of Obama himself, who ""has been a font of cool confidence, never too hot, never too cold, seemingly undaunted by the magnitude of troubles awaiting him and unbothered by the few setbacks that have tripped him up,"" writes Peter Baker in today's New York Times. ""He remains hard to read or label - centrist in his appointments and bipartisan in his style, yet also pushing the broadest expansion of government in generations ... He will eventually have to choose between competing advice and priorities, risking the disappointment or anger of constituencies that for the moment can still see in him what they hope to see."" Obama will inherit a catastrophic economic situation, a war he did not support, and a host of other problems - not least the towering public expectations for his administration.

65,2009-01-20T10:30:01Z,Opinion,The power of the inaugural word,Barack Obama's speech in a few hours' time offers a fascinating window on American history,"Just hours from now, Barack Obama will recite the brief, simple oath of fidelity to the American constitution that will formally make him the 44th president of the United States. Then, he will step up to the podium and deliver the most important speech of his life. His speech, like the oath of office, will be part of a tradition that began with George Washington in 1789. But unlike the oath to ""preserve, protect and defend"" the constitution, the inaugural address has undergone dramatic changes since Washington's day. There have been only 38 inaugural addresses. Five US presidents never gave their set-piece speech at all, having taken over for a portion of a full term from men whose lives were cut short either by an assassin's bullet, like Abraham Lincoln or John F Kennedy, or by illness. William Henry Harrison, who took the oath in 1841, famously delivered the longest inaugural: an oration rich in allusions not only to US constitutional law but also to Greek and Roman history. It lasted nearly two hours in a raging snowstorm. Harrison succumbed to pneumonia one month later. Rereading his words nearly two centuries later, it seems a miracle that he – or those listening – got through it at all. But the same could be said of many of the other inaugurals. Wading through all of them – as Obama and his principal speechwriter Jon Favreau have no doubt also been doing – offers a fascinating window on to American history. But moments of prose far outweigh flights of poetry, particularly in the early years. Few of the speeches have lived long beyond their delivery, and it is they, not surprisingly, that Obama will be seeking to emulate later today. Some themes have been constant – the enduring strength of the constitution, American democracy's sense of divine mission, the covenant between the president and the people who elected him and whose own participation is essential to any of the changes any new incumbent seeks to embody. They will inevitably figure in Obama's speech as well. But the models against whom Obama will inevitably be measured are the few presidents' whose inaugural words somehow soar and resonate still – three of them, above all. The most recent, John F Kennedy, was just 43 when he took office, five years Obama's junior, and memorably spoke of letting ""the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans"". And in an appeal frequently, but much more prosaically, heard in other inaugurals, Kennedy also urged Americans to ask not what their country could do for them, ""but what you can do for your country"". Franklin Delano Roosevelt who, taking office like Obama in the midst of a frightening economic meltdown, memorably declared: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" And when, in the second of his unprecedented four inaugurals the depression had begun to recede, he urged the country to a far wider purpose. ""The test of our progress,"" he said, ""is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much. It is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."" Above all, there is Abraham Lincoln. His importance to Obama, the first African American president, in the bicentenary year of Lincoln's birth, has been made explicit in the choice of the theme for his inaugural ceremony – ""a new birth of freedom"". That phrase comes not from Lincoln's inaugural addresses but from one of the briefest yet most enduring speeches delivered by any president – at the civil war battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. Yet Obama has frequently quoted a lofty passage from Lincoln's first inaugural – ironically, a speech that was aimed at averting civil war in part by assuring the southern states that he would not intervene to end slavery there. ""The mystic chords of memory,"" Lincoln said, ""stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" Obama is not alone in his admiration for Lincoln's oratory. None other than Richard Nixon also reached back to speak of our ""better angels"" in his first inaugural address. But it is not just the words that have distinguished the few presidential inaugurals that have truly stood the test of time. It has been a matrix of qualities: powerful and poetic phrases, movingly delivered, at a time when major challenges in America and the world have coincided with leadership that has found the perfect pitch with which to inspire his country to face them."
66,2009-01-20T18:22:07Z,Opinion,Gene Robinson's prayer: silent or silenced?,NA,"The choice of Gene Robinson to pray at the start of Sunday's inaugural concert was widely seen as a gesture by Obama to balance with an openly gay Christian his choice of the openly homophobic Rick Warren to invoke the blessings of God at the main ceremony today. After all, the inaugural concert was broadcast live to the nation on HBO – all of it, except the opening ten minutes, when Bishop Robinson was praying. Even people at the scene could hardly hear what he was saying, apparently: so his prayer was interrupted, like a rock concert, with cries of ""Turn it up"" and ""We can't hear"" (I assume God needs no amplifier, but who knows?). None of this was apparent to the watching millions because HBO broadcast none of it. The prayer was performed on schedule, at 2:20pm; it had finished when the concert and the broadcast started, also on schedule, at 2:30. Political and religious blogs roiled with outrage. At first HBO was blamed. Now the Obama Inaugural Committee have announced it is all their fault, just a silly misunderstanding, and the prayer will be edited back into the version of the concert which is played as a warm-up for the spectators today. None the less, it looks like a nifty piece of footwork to persuade the supporters of Bishop Robinson (who are the likeliest to attend a celebratory concert, or even the inaugural itself) that Obama is on their side, while suggesting the opposite to the much larger audience of Robinson's opponents, who will watch the whole thing on television. Obama's liberal supporters are understandably reluctant to believe this; but in a perverse kind of way, I hope it was a conspiracy. After all, the whole thing was organised by the Obama organisation, which has been marked by ruthless competence all through a campaign which no one at the beginning thought they had a chance to win. Now that he has won, he is expected to fulfil enormous irreconcilable and largely impossible expectations; a large part of his task over the next four years will be to persuade people that he has in fact done so. Persuading both pro- and anti-gay that he has responded to their concerns won't be anything like the hardest and most important task facing him; but if he couldn't have managed that, what hope he can manage the rest of them?"
67,2009-01-20T19:08:44Z,Opinion,Obama's rhetorical high notes,"With the beautiful imagery and pragmatic message of this speech, no one can now doubt that America is changing course","""You campaign in poetry, you govern in prose,"" Mario Cuomo, former governor of New York, once famously said. So which was it? Poetry or prose? That was the great balancing act of the speech. How much to inspire and generate even more hope and how much to talk of the scale of the task, the setbacks that will occur, the mistakes that will be made. Like past presidents he tried to reach for the rhetorical high notes that would define the moment. Perhaps, there was not one phrase that stole the show – no Kennedy ""Ask not what your country can do for you"" – but there were echoes of both Kennedy and Martin Luther King in his beautiful imagery. He is a natural speaker, who has the lilt of a preacher summoning his flock on a journey to the Promised Land. And Obama has perfected perhaps the greatest gift of the orator: the pause. When millions, perhaps billions, are watching you, it takes immense inner confidence to let people wait just a second longer for the next phrase. I remember all too well how high expectations were in 1997 when Tony Blair came to office after 18 years of the Tories – and how desperately we tried to suppress them. Well now after eight grim years of President Bush the world is not so much crying out for change as on its knees begging for change. To the governments and peoples of the world Obama offered not the dampening of expectations but the heightening of them – even going so far as promising the flourishing of poor farmers around the world. What he got spot on was the change of tone from the Bush era. This was what made the speech so striking. After this speech no one can be in any doubt that America is changing course. Talking of ""humility"", of the environment, of upholding values, of how America had to earn respect was not only a devastating attack on what had gone before but a signal to the world that there would be meaningful change. But if there was poetry to delight his supporters there was also the prosaic, the business-like: ""Everywhere we look there is work to be done"", he said, laying out the long list of crises at home and abroad needing immediate action. If Obama used his speech for one thing above all else it was to unify people around a common cause. Combining poetry and prose – ""let us brave once more the icy currents"" – he ended with a beautiful piece of imagery with a tough pragmatic message – the next few years are going to be tough but together we will get there."

""And we know today that Dr. King and a great cloud of witnesses are shouting in heaven"" was a terrific line. Nothing divisive. Until he got to the Lord's Prayer. Why did he have to throw that in? Pretty inappropriate? What were Jews and Muslims and Hindus supposed to do during that? And even Catholics, since he used the Protestant version? Bad form. •Joseph Lowery, the legendary civil rights activist, was great in his benediction. Especially the humor at the end: ""Lord, in the memory of all the saints who from their labors rest, and in the joy of a new beginning, we ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back, when brown can stick around . . .when yellow will be mellow . . .when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right."" I suppose some whiteys might be offended. This whitey is not. •Gorgeous performance by Itzhak Perlman, Yo Yo Ma, Anthony McGill and Gabriela Montero on John Williams' Air and Simple Gifts, a reworking of Copland's Appalachian Spring. Far more moving, for me, than Aretha Franklin's My Country 'Tis of Thee. She wasn't in her best voice. Williams' song had a perfect dramatic structure, and the performances were flawless and emotive. And man, those four weren't wearing any coats! Watch it here. •Elizabeth Alexander's poem: a little disappointing, I thought. In a way, it echoed Obama's speech. He was less soaring than we'd have expected; and she found no great poetic metaphor, no eternal or universal idea, but a series of prosaic images. It reads better on paper than it came across. She looked pretty nervous, or maybe she was just cold. Both understandable. Anyway, it was nice to have a poet there. That's all anybody will remember. •Ted Kennedy is fine and may go back to work as early as tomorrow, says John Kerry. Good news. •Now it turns out that some actual ticket-holders were turned away. Okay, anticipating everything in a crowd this size is pretty hard to do. But the gendarmes bungled this day, and there needs to be a review. Can you imagine a middle-class or working-class family from the Midwest somewhere who invested maybe $1,500 (on the cheap – more like twice that, probably) in coming here to witness history, having actual tickets in their hands, and dad having to explain to his kids that they weren't going to see it after all, just because the authorities weren't prepared for a crowd that was exactly the size that everyone anticipated it would be? It's scandalous. •Television coverage: I flipped back and forth between MSNBC and CNN. I make no value judgment of one over the other, but I merely note that they were a lot more yakky on MSNBC, while on CNN they didn't talk as much, let the images speak for themselves more. The winner of the day on TV though was John King. His little (actually, huge) photo montage (see www.cnn.com/themoment) was way cool. Check it out yourself, you can play with it online. •Michele is absolutely awesome. But we knew that. •On the fashion beat, by the way, she wore ""a sparkling yellow sheath dress with matching coat by Cuban-born American designer Isabel Toledo."" Joe Biden – who also had a great day, by the way; he has a terrifically genuine happy face – wore ""a navy Hickey Freeman suit he bought at the Nordstrom's in King of Prussia, Pa."" •Speaking of Biden, I liked the way they kept introducing ""Vice President and Dr. Biden."" Doctor. Jill Biden is, I'm pretty sure, the first non-Mrs. in the history of these affairs. That's a pretty groovy thing for all the little girls watching, no? •One thing to thank Bush for: no controversial last-day pardons. I remember that eight years ago, half the inauguration day talk about was about Marc Rich and some of the other Clinton exonerees. •As many have observed, Cheney in his wheelchair resembled no one so much as Mr. Potter in the later scenes of It's a Wonderful Life. Makes you wonder whether he stole some TARP money on the way out the door. •Could Chief Justice John Roberts had the worst day by far of anyone. How could he not even practice the oath of office? True, Obama jumped in there a beat early at first, and that may have thrown Roberts off. But HE SCREWED UP THE OATH OF OFFICE! How do you do that? He misplaced the word ""faithfully,"" then, I'm pretty certain, things got so cocked up that Obama didn't even say some of the words (""to the best of my ability,"" I think). I hope over the next eight years Obama rams three or four liberal justices down the guy's throat! •I walked along the Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday and looked at the windows and the rooftops, thinking about how many snipers would be on duty, and how they'd secure all those windows.

The opening post is from Macon Phillips, the Director of New Media for the White House. It doesn't look as though Obama will be posting, but Phillips says: Citizen participation will be a priority for the Administration, and the internet will play an important role in that. One significant addition to WhiteHouse.gov reflects a campaign promise from the President: we will publish all non-emergency legislation to the website for five days, and allow the public to review and comment before the President signs it. We'd also like to hear from you -- what sort of things would you find valuable from WhiteHouse.gov? If you have an idea, use this form to let us know. Like the transition website and the campaign's before that, this online community will continue to be a work in progress as we develop new features and content for you. So thanks in advance for your patience and for your feedback. That would, of course, sound a whole lot better if the post allowed comments…. During Obama's campaign, the @BarackObama handle was used to tweet news to followers, but this was abandoned after a ""We just made history"" post dated Nov 5th, 2008. It's not clear if that channel will be used again, but a post on 16 January added: To participate in the Inauguration visit http://pic2009.org or text HISTORY to 56333.

70,2009-01-20T10:32:34Z,News,Hudson plane's engine fan failed two days before crash-landing,Aircraft suffered compressor stall but was able to continue on with journey after it appeared to resume functioning,"The US Airways passenger jet that made a dramatic emergency landing on the Hudson river in New York last week had suffered an engine compressor failure two days earlier, the National Transportation Safety Board said today. ""An entry in the aircraft's maintenance log ... indicates [that] a compressor stall occurred on January 13,"" said a spokesman, Peter Knudson. The compressor, or fan, draws air into the engine. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who was hailed as a hero after all 155 people on board the Airbus 320 survived the emergency landing on 15 January, told air safety investigators the plane lost power to both engines after being hit by a flock of geese. Knudson said the aircraft was not being piloted by Sullenberger when the previous engine problem occurred. He said the board, which investigates transport accidents, planned to interview the pilot in question to learn more about the incident. Knudson said board investigators had not yet discovered ""any anomalies or malfunctions with Flight 1549 from the time it left the gate at LaGuardia airport on January 15 to the point the pilot reported a bird strike and loss of engine power"". CNN reported that passengers on the flight affected by the compressor stall – which also took off from LaGuardia, in New York – said they heard loud bangs followed by an announcement from the pilot that the aircraft was either returning to LaGuardia or would to try to land. There were differing accounts of the pilot's statements, but passengers said the situation appeared to return to normal a short time later and the flight continued on to Charlotte, North Carolina. It is not unusual for a plane to go on to its destination after a compressor stall if the engine returns to normal functioning. Robert Benzon, a senior NTSB investigator, said the examination of the Hudson crash-landing would take a year and the incident would ""be studied for decades"". He said lessons learned from the successful landing on the Hudson could improve air safety. The search for the plane's missing left engine is due to resume today after it was suspended yesterday because ice floes in the river made it too dangerous to put divers or special sonar equipment in the water. Sullenberger spoke to the US president-elect, Barack Obama, yesterday and was invited, with his crew and family, to attend today's inauguration."
71,2009-01-20T17:00:01Z,Opinion,Taking responsibility for Bush,"As we bid farewell to George Bush today, Democrats should acknowledge that they gave him a blank cheque after 9/11","As Americans celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama, they, like the rest of the world, are also taking tremendous satisfaction in the departure of the Bush regime. But of course the rest of the world didn't promote Bush to the exalted position from which he and his administration wrought such havoc and mayhem in the first place. That is a burden that must be borne distinctly and uniquely by the US. It is almost always forgotten and almost never noted that the Democrats gave Bush a blank cheque to invade and occupy Iraq less than one month before the 2002 midterm congressional elections. The Democratic strategy was to take the Iraq issue, reportedly in the words of then House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, ""off the table"". If the war resolution was passed, or so the theory went, then Democrats would be able to say ""see, we like to blow things up too"" or words to that effect, and then pivot to domestic issues where Democratic positions enjoyed more support than those of their Republican counterparts on the campaign trail. The Democrats, including senators John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and others who would unsuccessfully seek the presidency themselves in 2004 and 2008, as well as current Senate majority leader Harry Reid, would later contend that they had been ""misled"" by the Bush administration. But in far too many instances, Democrats didn't vote for the Iraq war because they were afraid of Saddam Hussein's WMDs. They voted for the Iraq war because they were afraid that if they didn't the Republicans would call them wimps. ""Neither side wants to talk about the context in which Bush won a blank cheque from Congress to invade Iraq,"" Washington Post columnist EJ Dionne wrote three years after the cheque had been delivered and gleefully endorsed by Bush. ""He doesn't want us to remember that he injected the war debate into the 2002 midterm election campaign for partisan purposes, and he doesn't want to acknowledge that he used the post-September 11 mood to do all he could to intimidate Democrats from raising questions more of them should have raised."" Dionne described the political pressure in the context of the midterm elections as ""a great missing element"" of the debate over how the nation got into the Iraq war. Capitulation to the Bush administration's blatantly optional warmongering on the part of Democrats in Congress was and will remain the most cynical, reckless and shameful act of their political careers. They were wimps all right. Just not for the reasons that the Republicans said. But as Dionne hinted, it is also an act for which the Democrats have mostly not been held accountable by the American media. Odd, that, since the media usually gets a bit of a kick out of exposing inconsistencies, hypocrisies, faults and mistakes, the party affiliation of the transgressor notwithstanding. Then again, the media itself behaved deplorably in the months leading up to the war. Journalists might be skittish about hammering Democrats for catastrophically errant warmongering since their own television news programmes were festooned with more stars and stripes and unquestioning nationalist fervour than at any time in memory, and certainly more than was seemly. Congressional Democrats and the media have come under at least some, albeit still rather isolated, scrutiny for their complicity in the horrible fiasco that is the Bush administration. Meantime, very little attention has been paid to another group that also shoulders a portion of the blame for US insanity that has marked the first decade of the still-young century: the American public. Along with Bush administration's ideological zealotry, arrogance and unquestioning certainty of the rightness of their course, facts be damned; along with Democratic spinelessness; along with media timidity and fear that someone somewhere might call them – gasp! – a liberal; and along with all the other causes and excuses both tragic and stupid that led to the invasion of Iraq, there is one other that tends to get overlooked: an attack polled well. After 9/11, people in the US were, not to put too fine a point on it, bloodthirsty as hell. But bombing the caves of poorly armed Taliban fighters in the Afghan wilderness was not nearly dramatic or conclusive enough to satisfy the lust for vengeance back in the US. Iraq – now there was a country with an actual army, in uniforms and stuff. Invading Iraq would be more of a regular war, a good war just like the one grandpa fought. Never mind that Iraq posed no threat to the security of US citizens as they drove to and fro in their SUV's festooned with patriotic auto magnets. Iraq was full of Arabs. And they didn't like us. In the words of one bumper sticker spotted at the time: ""Let's kick their ass and steal their gas."" Now the American public is more or less clinging to the same excuses offered up by the Democrats and the media – gosh, simply everybody thought that Iraq had WMDs (or something to do with 9/11, a lie that the Bush administration was more inclined to spread than discourage). Of course, from Hans Blix to Mohamed El Baradei to millions of protesters the world over, everybody didn't think that. And even many people who did still protested the war as an unnecessary exercise in military aggression on the part of untrustworthy warmongering ideologues. If a large segment of the American public was misled, perhaps it is because they were hearing what they wanted to believe. Oh boy! Another enemy! Bang bang! They eagerly backed arguably the biggest ""oops"" in recorded history. And then they ratified their mistake by re-electing Bush in 2004. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and others have urged that Bush and Company not be given a free pass for their criminal acts, that the Bush administration abuses should be investigated, no matter how uncomfortable such investigations might be for an Obama administration and a Democratic Congress that is understandably focused on the future, not the past. The fact is the US could do with some truth and reconciliation. But an honest assessment of the Bush years has to take account of the fact that, difficult though it is to believe at the moment, from 9/11 until Katrina the American public approved of Bush, often overwhelmingly and sometimes wildly. Yes, Americans can thank goodness or Goddy McGod or whoever/whatever it is they're in the habit of thanking for the departure of the worst president in history of the United States. Good riddance indeed. Meantime, it may take a while, but someday Americans are going to acknowledge that sometimes Bush wasn't leading them or misleading them. He was following them."
72,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Clemency and conversation in president's last day,NA,"President George Bush yesterday issued last-minute acts of clemency to two US border guards and made a final round of calls to world leaders, including Gordon Brown, to say goodbye. Ignacio Ramos and José Compeán were sentenced to 10 years for trying to cover up the shooting in 2005 of a Mexican drug dealer, Osvaldo Alderete, as he tried to escape across the Rio Grande, abandoning a van loaded with marijuana. The sentencing at the time produced an outcry, with supporters saying the pair were just doing their job. A US administration official said Bush agreed the sentence was excessive. Compeán and Ramos, who have served about two years, are expected to be released from prison within two months. The president can make pardons up till 11.59 am today, but Bush advisers said there would be no more. There had been expectations Bush might offer protection for US officials involved in torture at Guantánamo, and offer pardons in a raft of high-profile political and financial scandal cases. One of the biggest cases involved former White House adviser, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, who became caught up in a CIA leak scandal. Although Bush has already commuted his jail sentence, his supporters had hoped for a full pardon. Bush, who returned to the White House after a final weekend with his family at Camp David, phoned some leaders to thank them for their support during the eight years of his presidency. Among those he called was Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, who along with Tony Blair was one of his strongest supporters in Europe of the invasion of Iraq. Other leaders to receive a call included Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, and former president Vicente Fox of Mexico. Bush has one final act as president: handing over power to Barack Obama at noon tomorrow. But the press corps in Washington will also be watching to see whether, in spite of White House claims, he will make any further last-minute pardons, as his predecessors have done. With the new acts of clemency yesterday, Bush has granted a total of 189 pardons and 11 commutations, fewer than half as many as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan. Reagan issued 406 in eight years. The White House has been inundated with hundreds of pleas for clemency, including one from US senator Lisa Murkowski for the disgraced former Alaska senator Ted Stevens, a veteran Republican who was convicted in Washington in October of seven charges of felony for failing to declare gifts from an oil company."

That number is 25% more than last year. The attendance of 20 government delegations and 300 journalists at the World Future Energy Summit, has brought suggestions from one speaker that this had become the energy Davos, in reference to that yearly economic gathering. So no lack of interest then — despite the enormous cost of staying here and getting about in this petro-dollar fuelled Gulf state. But what about the overall mood in these times of credit crunches and looming global recession? Well, no one is pretending things are easy. London-based consultancy, New Energy Finance, produced figures recently that showed 50% increases in annual growth volumes for clean tech stocks three years in a row almost came to a grinding halt in 2008. Even BP admitted yesterday that its budgets were under pressure at a time of plunging crude prices. But despite continuing financial chaos among lenders (such as Royal Bank of Scotland), there is an overwhelming sense that the time has finally come for renewables, especially given the changes in the US, courtesy of Barack Obama. Solar companies were trumpeting their wares at the summit today with a procession of industry leaders who promised that their latest products were going to breakthrough the cost and efficiency barriers that have held back the sector. Kieran Drain, chief executive of California-based NanoGram outlined how lasers and nanotechnology can bring the holy grail of a new technology that fits between the traditional divide between high-efficiency crystal and low-cost photovoltaics. Kees van der Leun, a director of Holland's Econcern, said even without major technology breakthroughs the cost of producing solar cells was plummeting much quicker than politicians realised. He predicted prices would half in the next five or six years ""for sure."" He also poured cold water on statistics from the International Energy Agency which had talked about 10 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by 2020. ""I think [that target] will be done this year."" This is one of the reasons why many believe the Germans have spearheaded a new International Renewable Energy Agency. They want a more accurate assessment of where the sector has got to than the oil-driven IEA seems able to give. The British government told me last night they are still considering whether to join. Why? They won't say, but you suspect it's out of misplaced loyalty to the IEA which it helped establish and which sees IREA as a threat. Ridiculous — and it ensures the IREA will not be based in Britain. Read Terry Macalister's other blogs from Abu Dhabi here"

The company has announced several oil discoveries in Ghana and Uganda, and analysts said it would make sense for Tullow to raise cash to help develop them. The company is due to issue a trading update tomorrow, and one trader said: ""There was always a possibility they would ask for money, although it could just be that people realised there was an update tomorrow and put two and two together."" A company spokesman refused to comment, as did Tullow's broker. Tullow's shares closed 32p lower at 600.5p. But the banks were again the dominant feature of the day, with Lloyds Banking Group losing 20.2p to 44.8p on worries it could end up being nationalised by the UK government. Barclays fell 15.1p to 72.9p, while Royal Bank of Scotland, hit hard yesterday, saw an early bounce peter out and closed down 1.3p to 10.3p. A couple of new short disclosures were issued, with Landsdowne Global edging its bearish position in Barclays up from 0.25% to 0.26% and Paulson declared a 0.79% short in Lloyds. Talk that ratings agencies were nervous about UK debt levels given the amount the government is already pouring into the banks did not help overall sentiment, nor did another slump in the pound. Wall Street, closed yesterday for Martin Luther King day, celebrated Obama's big day by falling sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 140 points by the time London closed, while the FTSE 100 finished down 17.07 points at 4091.4. So with the banks under the cosh, many investors turned their attention to more defensive sectors. British American Tobacco closed 39p higher at £18.44 while pharmaceutical stocks were also in demand for their safe haven qualities, their status as dollar earners when the pound is crumbling, and hopes that Barack Obama will boost spending on US healthcare now his inauguration has finally taken place. AstraZeneca added 45p to £28.05, helped by a positive note from Citigroup, while GlaxoSmithKline rose 16.5p to £12.94 and Shire climbed 14p to £10.20. Medical group Smith &amp; Nephew, recommended by Exane BNP Paribas yesterday, closed 10.75p higher at 498p. There were some positive movements among the mid-caps after trading updates, with pubs group JD Wetherspoon 40.75p better at 315p, spread betting group IG 31.75p higher at 254p and luxury goods group Burberry up 25.5p to 231.25p. But downgrades from Credit Suisse hit property companies Brixton, down 14.5p at 105p, and Segro, 21.25p lower at 168.75p. Chip maker Wolfson Microelectronics lost 5p to 72p after being fined £140,000 by the City regulator for not releasing price sensitive information about a contract in time. Dan Ridsdale at Teathers said: ""The fine on Wolfson may force chip companies to disclose material design losses and wins sooner. Even if the customer is undisclosed, such a move is unlikely to be popular with original equipment manufacturers who demand confidentiality verging on secrecy."" Meanwhile he repeated his positive stance on CSR - down 8.75p at 157.25p - predicated on news shortly that it may have won a significant deal from Nokia."
75,2009-01-20T13:30:00Z,News,Pound hits 7-year low against the dollar,NA,"Sterling tumbled to its lowest level against the dollar in seven-and-a-half years today, as traders digested the implications of the government's latest multibillion-pound lifeline to support the banking sector. On the foreign exchange markets the pound shed more than six cents to hit $1.3860, its weakest point since June 2001. Banking shares also came under further pressure, with shares in Lloyds Banking Group plummeting almost 50% at one stage, to 33.8p. Barclays lost another 12% to 77.5p. Yesterday morning the pound was worth almost 10 cents more at $1.47, but proposals for the UK taxpayer to insure bank loans and support the mortgage market piled pressure on the currency. One commentator even claimed that the UK economy was ""finished"". News of a smaller-than-expected fall in inflation last month eased fears of deflation but failed to help sterling. City economists had forecast a fall in the consumer price index to 2.7% last month, down from 4.1% in November, but the figure came out at 3.1%. Gordon Brown yesterday committed £50bn to fund asset purchases by the Bank of England, but the final cost could be much higher and will require a further increase in government borrowing. ""The risk now is that people are looking back to the run on the pound in 1931, when Britain came off the gold standard and sterling fell by 31%,"" said Richard Turner of IG Index, the spread-betting company. Sterling has already dropped by a third from November 2007's high of $2.11 against the dollar. But with the dollar hitting a six-week high against a basket of major currencies today, there are fears that the pound could be poised for further falls. The pound also dropped against the euro to a two-week low of €1.0742. Turner believes that now the pound has fallen through the $1.40 mark, it could quickly slide as low as $1.30. He has seen an increase in the number of people short-selling sterling, betting that it will fall. ""Our clients are more comfortable about shorting the pound,"" said Turner. ""This isn't the unwinding of long trades; this is people speculating that sterling will go even lower."" Other traders said the inauguration of Barack Obama was helping the dollar, amid optimism over his economic recovery plan. British economy 'finished' Jim Rogers, the veteran US investor, claimed the UK economy was ""finished"". ""I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have,"" Rogers told Bloomberg. ""It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK."" Yesterday, Spain became the first major country to be downgraded by ratings agency S&amp;P, from the top rating of AAA to AA+. S&amp;P said the ""structural weaknesses"" in the Spanish economy, and the likelihood of a long recession, made holding the country's debt more risky. One City analyst said there was now a possibility the UK could follow Spain and see its debt downgraded, although S&amp;P indicated yesterday that the UK was in a better position to handle its growing debts. Meanwhile, renewed concern over the world economic downturn continued to hammer the oil price, which dropped 8% today. The cost of a barrel of US crude fell to $33.53, down more than $3. Economic data due out this week is expected to show that the Chinese economy, long the driver of global growth, is slowing fast. The UK will also officially be in recession from Friday, when the latest data is released. The oil price had risen in recent weeks in response to the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas, which cut supplies across parts of Europe. But that row appears to have been resolved, with the news that Gazprom is pumping gas through Ukraine again."
76,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,Opinion,The nuclear options,The latest bank salvage is plainly not enough. Soon we might be looking at a huge write-off of debts,"Nothing debauches the concept of money quite as much as watching it being thrown around like confetti by your bank manager. Anyone who claims to have kept up with the blizzard of blank cheques written on our behalf is missing the point: no one knows how much it will cost to prop up the British banking industry because no one knows whether it is worth anything at all. Yesterday's stockmarket reaction would suggest it isn't. Investors responded to the government's otherwise sensible rescue scheme by running for the exit doors. The only certainty is that lending by British banks during the boom was measured in trillions, not the mere billions we are throwing at the problem today. RBS alone has liabilities of £1.8 trillion. Nationalising it would increase the national debt by 370% - and that's not even counting the theoretical cost of financial derivatives, whose net worth we may never really know. It used to be unthinkable that the government would assume responsibility for anything quite so large. But the unthinkable is becoming official policy with terrifying speed. Yesterday saw the Bank of England warming up its printing presses, announcing the mechanism it would use for direct increases in the money supply when there is no more room for interest-rate cuts. Regulators also gave the green light for commercial banks to ""print"" more money, by easing the requirement for them to hold reserves when they make new loans. All three of these nuclear options (nationalisation, quantitative easing and relaxed reserve requirements) would ordinarily rank at the extreme end of the policy spectrum. But these are not ordinary times. So what happens if this doesn't work? When all else fails, the only logical conclusion is to forgive the debts. Just as we ultimately acknowledged the need to cancel third world debt, the time may have come to look into our own financial soul and move on from this debacle. As Niall Ferguson reminded us recently in his book on money, there is precedent in the Bible (Leviticus) for such a ""jubilee"" to be held every 50 years. ""Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother."" Keynes also called for a general cancellation of debts and reparations arising from the first world war. To an extent, this is already happening - when, for instance , banks ""write off"" toxic debt. Similarly, the large number of companies going bankrupt is a sign of borrowers walking away from unsustainable loans: the problem is that many also cease to trade at all. Anything on a more constructive scale would need international co-operation. Without that a jubilee would turn into a rout: international investors would flee the UK, and the City would lose what reputation it has left. But the good news is that almost everyone is in the same boat, and Barack Obama faces the problem on an even bigger scale. The same pressures are visible in the eurozone. So what's the catch? The obvious one is that for every debt, there is a saver. Where would that leave pensions - or in fact the whole system of capitalism? Until confidence was restored, firms and individuals would have to learn to live without investment, relying on cashflow to fund growth. It might delight Marxists, but it would be a socially retrograde step, entrenching the wealth gap in non-financial assets like property. Fortunately, things are not as bad as that yet. But the principle is one that could be extended in a targeted way, ring-fenced to protect ordinary savers. After all, if the banks are bankrupt then so is our financial system. dan.roberts@theguardian.com"
77,2009-01-20T07:00:01Z,Opinion,Russia must face reality,"The financial crisis should help the nation see it is not the world's leader-in-waiting, and start to address its creaking, corrupt reality","As Barack Obama prepares for his inauguration, one analyst has suggested that the US faces more serious trouble than even the most pessimistic economists have forecast. The entire economy is set to crash by November, leaving states fighting among themselves and leading to disintegration into six parts by summer 2010. As the weakened parts fall under foreign influence, Russia will take the golden opportunity to replace the US as the world's foremost superpower. According to the former KGB analyst and dean of the international relations department at the Russian foreign ministry's Diplomatic Academy, Igor Panarin, this scenario has ""a roughly 50% chance of coming true"". This theory has been receiving widespread attention in the Russian state-controlled media. Another story of a similar ilk has sat at the top of the state-backed Moscow News's most-read list for the past few months: a ""prophetess"" called Vanga has predicted that Russia will dominate the world. Economists' assessments of Russia, a country that currently accounts for about 3% of global GDP (comparable with the UK) and with per capita GDP at a quarter of the US level, are somewhat more sobering. Its economy is in serious trouble after years of neglected reforms, over-reliance on commodities and a failure to tackle rampant corruption. Some point to Russia's large currency reserves, but these have declined by over one quarter since August, and are rapidly disappearing to prop up the banking system, Kremlin-connected oligarchs and the sliding rouble. The recent gas conflict with Ukraine has been read by many as driven by the increasing financial woes of Gazprom and Russia. The Russian leadership's response to the crisis has so far had two main thrusts – first, to protect favoured oligarchs; second, to protect the leadership from popular dissent by stopping the rouble from plummeting. No one really knows how bad Russia's economic situation is because of an opacity fed by the desire to maintain calm and cover up problems and mistakes. But that image is struggling under the weight of the crisis. Factories stand idle across Russia, and surveys show that Russians are very worried about the economy as wage cuts and layoffs hit. In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, December's economic protests have turned political. For years, critics have pointed to the need for an open debate within Russia about the country's path in order to find the best way for economic and social progress and to minimise the effect of any crisis such as the current one. But with dollars dripping down from the top and state-controlled TV pushing the image of Putin and Russia as strong and growing after years of stagnation and hardship, ideas other than the Putin model struggled to take hold. But in Russia's history, crises have often served to sober up perceptions of the country. Nicholas I (1825-1855) was renowned as the ""gendarme of Europe"". During his reign, the intelligentsia complained constantly of repression from the state on the one hand and disinterest from people on the other. Then Russia was crushed by the British in the Crimean War. Nicholas committed suicide and Russian strength was revealed to be a self-propagating myth. As society opened up, interest increased in other paths that Russia could take; people began to discuss questions of reform. London-based Russian intellectual Alexander Herzen's journal The Bell, which detailed abuses of power by state officials and proposed new, different paths for Russia, was read avidly. This discussion led the way for the reforms of Alexander II. Public debate had opened up new possibilities for economic and social change, alternative paths to a country directed by autocratic decision alone (which were ultimately not taken). As the crisis increasingly reveals the gulf between Russia's self-image and its real possibilities, the time of Panarin and Vanga could be coming to an end. Talk will surely move from fantasies about Russia challenging the US to the country's very real internal problems and how to solve them. Previously deaf ears will begin to listen as the failures of the current leadership become clear in everyday life. The question that will then be raised is one that has been asked of Russian leaders for centuries: liberalisation, or crack down?"
78,2009-01-19T23:01:00Z,News,Diary,NA,"Amid both joy and euphoria, the threats to Obama are many. We need not dwell on them. Others are on the case. We have an official threat and analysis bulletin released in Washington that lists incidents and possible problems over the inauguration period. Among the incidents picked up on the radar, clearly a strong one is ""Starbucks Site Firebombed in London"". It tells of an attack in Whitechapel, linked, it says, to ugly tensions unleashed by the crisis in the Gaza Strip, and adds: ""The people in this constituency have a history of voting for the RESPECT Party run by George Galloway MP."" Recently, it says, he called on supporters to ""go to shopping centers and shut down Israel's shops"". In fact, he sought a boycott of Israel Shops, mobile retailers selling Israeli goods from malls - but they're right, George is always worth watching, even from the US. Never dull. Who should get the blame, or perhaps take credit, for Labour's big idea on social mobility: the duty on public authorities to pursue social equality? Should it be Harriet Harman, or Trevor Phillips who is said to feel a ""pang of annoyance"" that Harriet is publicly identified with what could be Labour's greatest legislative achievement. It is the equalities commission, some say, that has been in the box seat. ""I am obsessed by it, therefore colleagues are having to be interested in it,"" muttered Phillips the other day. Alas, the price of obsession. Yes, class is on the agenda again, and while the middle classes have a fine time, every group has problems. Danny Wallace, comedian and author, gives readers of Shortlist magazine two examples overheard. ""The only seat in the bistro was on a communal table but in the end it was fine as I found myself folded into the cultural melee,"" said one sufferer. ""I keep confusing the name of my cleaner with the name of the heroine in my novel,"" moaned the other. Does anyone care for these people? Who empathises. Not Harriet. Not Trevor. Raised stakes within the National Union of Students, where there is lively debate about constitutional plans that might exclude minority representatives from a new decision-making body. The scrap has been fought internally, but with a vote due today, the NUS black students campaign has brought in the big guns: try Doreen Lawrence, Benjamin Zephaniah and Diane Abbott. But when it sought to publicise this fact last week, its emails were blocked by union HQ. It's getting nasty. Heads down. So what shall we say about Dubya, the artist formerly known as the leader of the free world? Will we, with just the faintest nod to Shakespeare, look kindly upon him; say that nothing in his presidency became him like the leaving of it. Much more important is the question of what we shall say on his farewell bumper sticker, and it has been a tough choice to be sure. We had many entries, for which we are grateful, and though the humour was gentle, none showed even a scintilla of respect or regard for the man. We respect that. Take a bow. Our panel of judges, all drawn from privatised companies with undeclared links to Dick Cheney, and thus all shielded from prosecution, liked Tom Burnett's suggestion: ""Obama's in hand, worth two of a Bush""; while Derrick Cameron deserves mention for his creation: ""I came, Iraq, I fucked it up"" - best said in a Texan drawl. The judges also applauded the overview of two disastrous terms, submitted by Mike Walton, for ""Fiddled in - Drummed out"" would make a super bumper sticker, and indeed a thoughtful title for Dubya's memoir. (This will be ready just as soon as Mr Cheney is able to finish it. Please, a little more patience.) But at the end of the day, what we wanted was something that would look good on the former president's pick-up as it trundles away from Washington en route to Texas - and this we found in Deirdre Mason's winning vision: ""No, Dubya - sunset's THIS way"". Bye bye to him. Well done to her. diary@theguardian.com"
79,2009-01-20T20:11:42Z,News,Calls to nationalise RBS and Lloyds as markets lose faith in bail-outs,Sterling hammered on currency markets as traders take fright at state of UK banking sector and cost of government rescue,"John McFall, confidant of Gordon Brown and chairman of the Treasury select committee, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland tonight after shares in both banks crumbled, the pound skidded to a seven-year low against the dollar and government bonds were sold off sharply. As markets took fright at the state of Britain's banking sector and the wider economy the day after the government's latest bail-out plan, shares in the loss-making RBS slumped to 10.3p, continuing Monday's 66% slide, while the new Lloyds Banking Group continued to fall rapidly as it looked likely that many UK banks would not be paying any dividends for years. McFall, an influential Labour MP, called for the complete nationalisation of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland ""for the sake of financial stability"". In an article in the Financial Times co-authored by the veteran private equity expert Jon Moulton, McFall said: ""Let us get it over with – nationalise the pair of them."" The pound fell to $1.386, hitting the lowest point since June 2001. It also slumped below €1.07. Sterling was not helped by a surge of confidence in the dollar, as Barack Obama was sworn in as US president. Jim Rogers, a veteran US investor, said the UK economy was ""finished"". He told Bloomberg: ""I would urge you to sell any sterling. It's finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the UK."" Rumours were awash in febrile markets that ratings agencies could downgrade the UK's sovereign debt ratings if the government had to issue tens of billions of pounds of government bonds to finance its latest rescue for the banks. A downgrade would increase the cost of raising debt for Britain, the world's fifth largest economy. The price of insuring British debt against default also rose sharply. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, was forced in Brussels to dismiss market talk that he, like Denis Healey in 1976, would have to turn to the IMF for a bail-out, saying he had laid out at the pre-budget report in November how he intended to pay for the government's schemes. But Peer Steinbrück, Germany's finance minister, also at the EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels, said he and others had urged a swift return to sound public finances and expressed fears about the situation in Britain, which is forecast to have a 9.5% budget deficit next year, and Ireland, whose deficit in 2010 is put at 13%. Saying he did not understand Darling's scheme to insure UK banks' multibillion-pound toxic assets via the Bank of England and a ""bad bank"", he said: ""I am sceptical that a national scheme will work."" Steinbrück echoed market fears about the UK scheme by saying it was unclear how to find the right price for the securities in a bad bank. The bank might have to be capitalised with up to 30% of what was on lenders' balance sheets – up to €200bn. The bail-out also worries the City. ""The market rightly fears the long-term fiscal costs of a collapsing banking system,"" said Graham Turner, of consultancy GFC Economics. The gilts market was spooked by the potential costs to the public purse. Gilts prices fell sharply on the fear of greater supply, which in turn pushed yields up to 3.55% for a 10-year benchmark gilt. Falling yields recently have helped bring down the price of some corporate borrowing and fixed-rate mortgages. Shares in Lloyds lost half their value before ending 31% lower at 44.8p. Lloyds' stockmarket value is just £6bn – barely half the sum put in by the taxpayer. RBS, soon to be almost 70% state-owned after a £20bn cash injection, has a stockmarket value of less than £4bn. In 2007 it was worth £78bn. Barclays was also hit hard, touching 69p before ending 17% down at 72.9p, to be worth £6bn – little more than the £5.3bn of profits it expects for 2008 and down from £58bn 18 months ago. Even HSBC, the UK's biggest bank and the only one not to have raised funds from investors, was caught in the rout. It fell 3% to a stockmarket value of about £58bn – less than half the £120bn it was valued at before the credit crunch began. Darling insisted he had won backing in Brussels for the bail-out. EU ministers said: ""Member states continue to remain committed to taking all necessary steps."" He said the statement proposed to the EU's Czech presidency by Britain – which demands the proper functioning of credit channels through banks' use of their capital reserves – showed EU unity. News that UK inflation had its biggest fall in 17 years, dropping to 3.1% in December from 4.1% a month before, did little to calm markets, partly because it had been expected to fall further, but also because the Bank of England has already slashed interest rates to a historic low of 1.5% and is widely expected to cut them further. Mervyn King, Bank governor, paved the way last night for ""quantitative easing"" – radical steps to combat deflation and thaw credit markets – by promising to start buying corporate bonds and other assets within ""weeks, not months"", to pump cash into the system. In a speech to the CBI in Nottingham, he said the Bank was ready to take ""unconventional measures"" to kick-start the economy, once the weapon of interest rate cuts was exhausted. King said as well as buying bonds and other securities (to raise reserves on banks' balance sheets and encourage them to lend) the Bank would also consider buying particular classes of assets where markets were malfunctioning. He also threw his weight behind Alistair Darling's new rescue package for the banking sector. A minister has admitted that the centre-piece of the rescue – the scheme to insure banks against unexpected losses – may last nine years. The admission made by the City minister, Lord Myners, contrasts with Gordon Brown's claim on Monday that the scheme would be short-lived. Myners told peers: ""We are probably talking about a policy duration of no fewer than five years, and probably no longer than eight or nine years … we need a policy that will take financial markets through this economic downturn and beyond."" Inflation is widely expected to turn to deflation this year as the recession deepens and the impact of falling oil prices feeds fully into the figure. Oil prices fell as low as $32.70 a barrel yesterday, partly on the resumption of Russian gas supplies and partly due to renewed strength in the dollar. That is barely a fifth of the record level hit last summer. The FTSE 100, though, was little moved overall, closing at 4091.17 points on the day as firming pharmaceutical, tobacco and oil shares counterbalanced the losses in bank shares.
